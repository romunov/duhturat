#' Calculate contribution area of the sampling area based on walk distance
#' accumulation curve.
#' 
#' Cells that are outside the reach, but inside the sampling area, of the
#' accumulation curve, are not calculated and are assumed to be one. Cells in
#' the rim around the border sampling area are found and each cell's
#' contribution is found.
#' Cell calculations are done on multiple cores using snowfall package.
#' 
#' @param sap.poly SpatialPolygons. Polygon of the sampling area.
#' @param effect.distance Numeric. Distance of the maximum walk.
#' @param ring.weigts data.frame/list. A list of data.frames with columns for
#' lower, mean and upper bounds of the accumulation distance curve.
#' @param .object RasterLayer. An empty RasterLayer object of the sampling area
#' with some padding.
#' @param ... Arguments passed to \code{snowfall::sfInit}, e.g. \code{cpus}
#' and \code{type}.
