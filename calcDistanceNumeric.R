#' This function calculates distance from a point within a specified radius.
#' It returns a raster object. Technically, this function finds which cells
#' are within the radius of effect.distance from origin point, get their co-
#' ordinates and uses pointDistance() to calculate their value based on distance
#' from origin point.
#' 
#' # This function is different from calcDistance only by the way the masking is
#' done. calcDistance uses raster::mask while here, we just subset using vector
#' indexing.
#' 
#' @param origin.point Matrix. A 1x2 matrix (can be extracted from a bigger n*2 matrix 
#'			with [i, ] operator) denoting coordinates of the origin points from
#'			where distances will be calculated.
#' @param object RasterLayer object where drama takes place. Must be raster with 
#'			values \code{1:ncell(raster)}. This is because we use extract() to 
#'			extract a buffer around the origin point, which reads only values,
#'			and not their position.
#' @param effect.distance Numeric. A number specifying the radius from the origin point.
#'			All points within this radius will be used to calculate distances. 
#'			WARNING: If effect distance is bigger than area/2, buffer falls 
#'			outside raster range and xyValues() fails. The function should return
#'			a vector (because of unlist) of values, but when at least one value
#'			falls outside the raster range, only one NA is returned. This will
#'			result in an epic function fail.
#' @param ring.weights A vector of values of the curve used to construct the
#' 			contribution area.
#' @param empty.object An empty RasterLayer object into which the result is inserted.
#' 			Must be of the same dimensions as \code{object}.
#' @param raster.mask Numeric or RasterLayer object. Used to mask out only the desired
#'       portion of the base layer. 
#' @return Numeric. Contribution (a proportion) of area inside the sampling area.
