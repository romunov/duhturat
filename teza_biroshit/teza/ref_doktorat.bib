	abstract = {1. Activity level (the proportion of time that animals spend active) is a behavioural and ecological metric that can provide an indicator of energetics, foraging effort and exposure to risk. However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasiveway. 2. This article presents a newmethod to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. 3. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activ- ity level can reliably be estimated using the newmethod. 4. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to bemet formany species, butmay be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitudewinters.Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.},

TBE is transmitted to humans usually by the bite of a tick (either Ixodes persulcatus or Ixodes ricinus); occasionally, cases occur following consumption of infected unpasteurized milk. Transmission is seasonal and occurs in spring and summer, particularly in rural areas favored by the vector. TBE is a serious cause of acute central nervous system disease, which may result in death or long-term neurological sequelae. Effective vaccines are available in a few countries. The risk for travelers of acquiring TBE is increasing with the recent rise in tourism to areas of endemicity during spring and summer.},

Research in this area has increased in recent decades, creating a plethora of options for study design and analysis. Here we present a practical toolbox for the design and analysis of landscape genetics studies following a seven-step framework: (1) define the study objectives, (2) consider the spatial and temporal scale of the study, (3) design a sampling regime, (4) select a genetic marker, (5) generate genetic input data, (6) generate spatial input data, and (7) choose an analytical method that integrates genetic and spatial data. Study design considerations discussed include choices of spatial and temporal scale, sample size and spatial distribution, and genetic marker selection. We present analytical methods suitable for achieving different study objectives. As emerging technologies generate genetic and spatial data sets of increasing size, complexity, and resolution, landscape geneticists are challenged to execute hypothesis-driven research that combines empirical data and simulation modeling. The landscape genetics framework presented here can accommodate new design considerations and analyses, and facilitate integration of genetic and spatial data by guiding new landscape geneticists through study design, implementation, and analysis.},

	abstract = {The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

Our modeling framework can be used to make reliable inferences on abundance as well as recruitment, immigration, stage-specific survival, and detection rates during sampling. We present a range of simulations to illustrate the data requirements, including the number of years and locations necessary for accurate and precise parameter estimates. We apply our modeling framework to a population of northern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus) in the mid-Atlantic region (USA) and find that the population is unexpectedly declining. Our approach represents a valuable advance in the estimation of population dynamics using multistate data from unmarked individuals and should additionally be useful in the development of integrated models that combine data from intensive (e.g., mark-recapture) and extensive (e.g., counts) data sources.},

	abstract = {* Animal movements are the primary behavioural adaptation to spatiotemporal heterogeneity in resource availability. Depending on their spatiotemporal scale, movements have been categorized into distinct functional groups (e.g. foraging movements, dispersal, migration), and have been studied using different methodologies. We suggest striving towards the development of a coherent framework based on the ultimate function of all movement types, which is to increase individual fitness through an optimal exploitation of resources varying in space and time. * We developed a novel approach to simultaneously study movements at different spatiotemporal scales based on the following proposed theory: the length and frequency of animal movements are determined by the interaction between temporal autocorrelation in resource availability and spatial autocorrelation in changes in resource availability. We hypothesized that for each time interval the spatiotemporal scales of moose Alces alces movements correspond to the spatiotemporal scales of variation in the gains derived from resource exploitation when taking into account the costs of movements (represented by their proxies, forage availability NDVI and snow depth respectively). The scales of change in NDVI and snow were quantified using wave theory, and were related to the scale of moose movement using linear mixed models. * In support of the proposed theory we found that frequent, smaller scale movements were triggered by fast, small-scale ripples of changes, whereas infrequent, larger scale movements matched slow, large-scale waves of change in resource availability. Similarly, moose inhabiting ranges characterized by larger scale waves of change in the onset of spring migrated longer distances. * We showed that the scales of movements are driven by the scales of changes in the net profitability of trophic resources. Our approach can be extended to include drivers of movements other than trophic resources (e.g. population density, density of related individuals, predation risk) and may facilitate the assessment of the impact of environmental changes on community dynamics and conservation.},

Most game species population monitoring programs assume that count indices are proportionally related to abundance. However, this assumption is untenable when detection varies spatially and temporally. We assessed whether N-mixture models, which allow detection modeling using spatially and temporally repeated count data, were relevant for monitoring the population of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). Unbiased estimates are needed for calculating hunting quotas for this game species.Weused the simple aural playback point-countmethod and a dataset of 121 point-transects (n¼16,288 counts) collected from 1992 to 2010. Covariates such as date, hour, wind, rain, and vegetation density influenced detection probability. Estimated abundance ranged from 0 to 15 males per point and exhibited variable coefficients of variation depending on sites (range: 0.14–1.31, mean: 0.44). We found a positive and linear relationship between the abundance estimated by the N-mixture model and the densities provided by 2 other counting methods, square sampling and kilometric abundance index, but not with blank beat. We established a maximum detection radius for the playback surveys, which enabled conversion of abundance at the points into density. The N-mixture modeling approach is more cost-effective for game species monitoring than capture–recapture methods or square sampling, and more reliable than indices of relative abundances},

We used 508 community-specific infection presence data collated from the published literature in conjunction with five predictive environmental/climatic and demographic variables, and a maximum entropy niche modelling method to construct the first ecological niche maps describing potential distribution and burden of LF in Africa. We also ran the best-fit model against climate projections made by the HADCM3 and CCCMA models for 2050 under A2a and B2a scenarios to simulate the likely distribution of LF under future climate and population changes. We predict a broad geographic distribution of LF in Africa extending from the west to the east across the middle region of the continent, with high probabilities of occurrence in the Western Africa compared to large areas of medium probability interspersed with smaller areas of high probability in Central and Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. We uncovered complex relationships between predictor ecological niche variables and the probability of LF occurrence. We show for the first time that predicted climate change and population growth will expand both the range and risk of LF infection (and ultimately disease) in an endemic region. We estimate that populations at risk to LF may range from 543 and 804 million currently, and that this could rise to between 1.65 to 1.86 billion in the future depending on the climate scenario used and thresholds applied to signify infection presence.},

In 1978 the first confirmed reproduction on the peninsula in 14 years was recorded. During 20 successive winters, from 1978-1979 to 1997-1998, the status, distribution, and dynamics of the wolf population were monitored by snow-tracking as a cooperative Swedish-Norwegian project. After the 1978 reproduction in northern Sweden, all new pairs and packs were located in south-central parts of the Scandinavian peninsula. Between 1983 and 1990 wolves reproduced each year except 1986, but in only one territory. There was no population growth during this period and the population never exceeded 10 animals. In 1991 reproduction was recorded in two territories. After that there were multiple reproductions each year and the population started growing. In 1998 there were 50-72 wolves and six reproducing packs on the peninsula. Between 1991 and 1998 the annual growth rate was 1.29 0.035 (mean SD). A minimum of 25 litters were born during the study period. The early-winter size of packs reproducing for the first time was 6.2 1.4 wolves (n = 9), and this decreased with time during the study. The size of packs that had reproduced more than once was 6.4 1.8 wolves (n = 12), and this increased with time over the study period. All but 1 of 30 reported wolf deaths were human-caused. The annual mortality rate was 0.13 0.11, and this decreased with time during the study period. The minimum dispersal distance was 323 212 km for males and 123 67 km for females. Of 10 new wolf territories where breeding occurred, only 1 bordered other, existing territories. The distance from newly established wolf pairs to the nearest existing packs was 119 73 km. Simulation of population growth based on known reproductions and mortalities showed a close similarity to the results from population censuses up to the mid-1990s.

	abstract = {1.Studies of demographic processes are typically restricted to small geographic areas and short time periods due to the costs of marking and monitoring individuals. However, environmental changes are occurring at much broader spatial and temporal scales and thus inferences about the mechanisms governing population dynamics need to be scaled accordingly. Recently developed integrated population models (IPMs) represent an approach for doing so, by jointly analyzing survey data and capture-recapture data. 2.Although promising, several shortcomings of conventional IPMs exist, including difficulties accounting for spatial variation in demographic, movement, and detection parameters; limited ability to make spatially explicit predictions of abundance or vital rates; and a requirement that the survey data and the capture-recapture data are independent. We demonstrate how each of these limitations can be resolved by adopting a spatial population dynamics model upon which both the survey data and the capture-recapture data are conditioned. 3.We applied the model to six years of hair data collected on the threatened Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus). For years in which the hair samples were genotyped, the resulting data are information rich (but expensive) spatial capture-recapture (SCR) data. For the remaining years, the data are binary detection data, of the type often analyzed using occupancy models. We compared estimates of demographic parameters and annual abundance using various combinations of the SCR and detection data, and found that combining the SCR data and the detection data resulted in more precise estimates of abundance relative to estimates that did not use the detection data. A simulation study provided additional evidence of increased precision, as well as evidence that the estimators of annual abundance are approximately unbiased. 4.The ability to combine survey data and capture-recapture data using a spatially explicit model opens many possibilities for designing cost effective studies and scaling up inferences about the demographic processes influencing spatial and temporal population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Both local and regional processes may contribute to community diversity and structure at local scales. Although many studies have investigated patterns of local or regional community structure, few have addressed the extent to which local community structure influences patterns within regional species pools. Here we investigate the role of body size in community assembly at local and regional scales in Ctenotus lizards from arid Australia. Ctenotus has long been noted for its exceptional species diversity in the Australian arid-zone, and previous studies have attempted to elucidate the processes underlying species coexistence within communities of these lizards. However, no consensus has emerged on the role of interspecific competition in the assembly and maintenance of Ctenotus communities. We studied Ctenotus communities at several hundred sites in the arid interior of Australia to test the hypothesis that body sizes within local and regional Ctenotus assemblages should be overdispersed relative to null models of community assembly, and we explored the relationship between body size dispersion at local and regional scales. Results indicate a striking pattern of community-wide overdispersion of body size at local scales, as measured by the variance in size ratios among co-occurring species. However, we find no evidence for body size overdispersion within regional species pools, suggesting a lack of correspondence between processes influencing the distribution of species phenotypes at local and regional scales. We suggest that size ratio constancy in Ctenotus communities may have resulted from contemporary ecological interactions among species or ecological character displacement, and we discuss alternative explanations for the observed patterns.},

	abstract = {Understanding the population dynamics of top-predators is essential to assess their impact on ecosystems and to guide their management. Key to this understanding is identifying the mechanisms regulating vital rates. Determining the influence of density on survival is necessary to understand the extent to which human-caused mortality is compensatory or additive. In wolves (Canis lupus), empirical evidence for density-dependent survival is lacking. Dispersal is considered the principal way in which wolves adjust their numbers to prey supply or compensate for human exploitation. However, studies to date have primarily focused on exploited wolf populations, in which density-dependent mechanisms are likely weak due to artificially low wolf densities. Using 13 years of data on 280 collared wolves in Yellowstone National Park, we assessed the effect of wolf density, prey abundance and population structure, as well as winter severity, on age-specific survival in two areas (prey-rich vs. prey-poor) of the national park. We further analysed cause-specific mortality and explored the factors driving intraspecific aggression in the prey-rich northern area of the park. Overall, survival rates decreased during the study. In northern Yellowstone, density dependence regulated adult survival through an increase in intraspecific aggression, independent of prey availability. In the interior of the park, adult survival was less variable and density-independent, despite reduced prey availability. There was no effect of prey population structure in northern Yellowstone, or of winter severity in either area. Survival was similar among yearlings and adults, but lower for adults older than 6 years. Our results indicate that density-dependent intraspecific aggression is a major driver of adult wolf survival in northern Yellowstone, suggesting intrinsic density-dependent mechanisms have the potential to regulate wolf populations at high ungulate densities. When low prey availability or high removal rates maintain wolves at lower densities, limited inter-pack interactions may prevent density-dependent survival, consistent with our findings in the interior of the park.},

	abstract = {Conservation and management agencies require accurate and precise estimates of abundance when considering the status of a species and the need for directed actions. Due to the proliferation of remote sampling cameras, there has been an increase in capture–recapture studies that estimate the abundance of rare and/or elusive species using closed capture–recapture estimators (C–R). However, data from these studies often do not meet necessary statistical assumptions. Common attributes of these data are (1) infrequent detections, (2) a small number of individuals detected, (3) long survey durations, and (4) variability in detection among individuals. We believe there is a need for guidance when analyzing this type of sparse data. We highlight statistical limitations of closed C–R estimators when data are sparse and suggest an alternative approach over the conventional use of the Jackknife estimator. Our approach aims to maximize the probability individuals are detected at least once over the entire sampling period, thus making the modeling of variability in the detection process irrelevant, estimating abundance accurately and precisely. We use simulations to demonstrate when using the unconditional-likelihood M 0 (constant detection probability) closed C–R estimator with profile-likelihood confidence intervals provides reliable results even when detection varies by individual. If each individual in the population is detected on average of at least 2.5 times, abundance estimates are accurate and precise. When studies sample the same species at multiple areas or at the same area over time, we suggest sharing detection information across datasets to increase precision when estimating abundance. The approach suggested here should be useful for monitoring small populations of species that are difficult to detect.},

	abstract = {1. Use of radar in ornithology, chiropterology and entomology continues to increase, driven in part by wide- spread online data availability. In addition to research applications, rapid growth in areas such as wind energy and aviation has prompted the use of radar for conservation.While a variety of research applications motivate ecologists to gain basic radar literacy, the ability to process and analyse radar data sets can be a daunting task thatmay dissuade inexperienced ecological radar users. This effect is exacerbated by vague radarmethodologies in the ecology literature, as well as the combination of complex techniques and unfamiliar terminology in other radar-focused disciplines. 2. While radar data come in many formats and levels of detail, a common type is the two-dimensional radar image. As rasters of data with associated spatial coordinates, radar images are relatively easy to manipulate, especially for those familiar with basic raster computations. Furthermore, because radar image data require relatively small storage space, they can be readily downloaded from a number of online sources. With this in mind, radar images provide a convenient foundation for ecological applications. 3. A primer on radar image interpretation and processing is presented, with a focus on image composition for typical atmospheric surveillance radar scans. Additionally, a selection of existing ecological radar image process- ing methods are overviewed. As a starting point, a basic algorithm for automated image processing is outlined that may be modified to create specialized workflows. Three examples of the application of this algorithm are included, illustrating itsmodification and use for automated feature extraction. 4. By outlining a basic algorithm, we hope to provide a clear starting point for the beginning radar user.When combined with additional existing methods, this algorithm provides a wide range of refinements and modifica- tions that can pave a path towards sophisticated radar processingworkflows. In the long term, the ability of ecol- ogists to independently analyse radar data will lead to better ecological interpretation of radar data and amore informed application toconservationpolicy.},

To solve this bias, spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models have recently been developed. These models incorporate movement and can identify areas where it is more likely for individuals to concentrate their activity. In this study, we used data from camera–trap surveys of common genets (Genetta genetta) in Serra da Malcata (Portugal), designed to compare abundance estimates produced by SECR models with traditional closed–capture models. Using the SECR models, we observed spatial heterogeneity in genet distribution and density estimates were approximately two times lower than those obtained from the closed popula� tion models. The non–spatial model estimates were constrained to sampling grid size and likely underestimated movements, thereby overestimating density. Future research should consider the incorporation of cost–weighed models that can include explicit hypothesis on how environmental variables influence the distance metric.},

Forty-eight Polychaetes species, which belong to 16 families, were identified among 10 593 individuals. The different distribution in space and time can be attributed to the life cycles of the Polychaetes, and also to the various biotic interactions. In general, the abundance follows the succession of the seasons, with some deviations though. Thus, the samples can be divided into two major groups, the winter and summer samples. The structure of the feeding guilds of the Polycheates population was also investigated and 9 different feeding guilds were identified. The microphagous, sedentary Polychaetes were the dominant guild, whilst the carnivores were the most abundant among the macrophagous. No major differences were observed, as regards the composition of the feeding guilds. The study of the structure of the polychaetofauna showed similar diversity with that of other Mediterranean regions. This fact implies that the polychaetofauna of the M. galloprovincialis assemblages in the Mediterranean Sea has a stable structure and shows a certain resemblance. Furthermore, the polychaetofauna includes species known as capable of living in polluted water as well as others that are more sensitive in such conditions. Therefore, the biomonitoring of the examined regions proves to be essential for obtaining valuable information about the state of their waters.

Several recent articles have shown the close relationships between these methods [1] [15]. We explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural object of inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability (which is only defined with reference to quadrat size), and why presence-only data only allows estimation of relative, and not absolute intensities. All three of the above techniques amount to parametric density esti- mation under the same exponential family model. We show that the IPP and Maxent models give the exact same estimate for this density, but lo- gistic regression in general produces a different estimate in finite samples. When the model is misspecified, logistic regression and the IPP may have substantially different asymptotic limits with large data sets. We propose “infinitely weighted logistic regression,” which is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend the Maxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways using this technique. Finally, we address the issue of observer bias, modeling the presence- only data set as a thinned IPP.We discuss when the observer bias problem can solved by regression adjustment, and additionally propose a novel method for combining presence-only and presence-absence records from one or more species to account for it.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. We present the results of a camera trap survey conducted in 2008 in the Atlantic Forest of Iguazú National Park, Misiones, Argentina, testing whether placing camera traps on dirt roads/trails or in off-road locations produce important biases in the recorded species. Seven pairs of camera trap stations were active for 26.6 ± 8.9 days; for each pair, one station was located on a narrow unpaved road and the other about 50 m from the road. We used the first order Jackknife estimator to compare species richness between on-road vs. off-road locations. We used records from another camera trap survey conducted at Iguazú National Park in 2006-2007 to assess whether species with a high Road-use Index (ratio of photographs of animals walking along roads to photographs of animals crossing the roads) had a higher ratio of records on roads/off road sta- tions in the 2008 survey. Multivariate ANOVA based on dissimilarities (ADONIS) was used to compare mam- mal assemblages recorded at stations located on roads vs. off roads. We obtained 228 independent records of 15 species of medium-large sized terrestrial mammals. Stations located on roads had a higher recording rate (1.06, SD = 0.57 vs. 0.24, SD = 0.13 records per day) and recorded more species than off-road stations (15 vs. 10 recorded species; 19.3, SE = 2.8 vs. 14.3, SE = 2.8 species estimated with the 1st order Jackknife model). Species differ in their relative probabilities of being recorded on roads vs. off roads, something that can be predicted with the Road-use Index. The ADONIS indicated that the mammal assemblage surveyed on roads was statisti- cally dissimilar to that surveyed off roads, a result that can be explained by the differential tendency of the species to use roads and trails.},

Attributes of camera trapping we cover include: (i) specifying the model(s) of camera traps(s) used, (ii) mode of deployment, (iii) camera settings, and (iv) study design. In addition to suggestions regarding best practice data coding and analysis, we present minimum principles for standardizing information that we believe should be reported in all peer-reviewed papers.

Precise and unbiased estimates are nonetheless mostly difficult to obtain, as estimates based on abundance over unit area are frequently inflated due to the “edge effect” bias. This may lead to the implementation of inappropriate management and conservation decisions. In an attempt to obtain an as accurate and conservative as possible picture of Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) numbers, we combined radio tracking data from a subset of tracked individuals from an extensive project on otter ecology performed in Southern Portugal with information stemming from other data sources, including trapping, carcasses, direct observation of tagged and untagged individuals, relatedness estimates among genotyped individuals, and a minor contribution from non-invasive genetic sampling. In 158 km of water network, which covers a sampling area of 161 km2 and corresponds to the minimum convex polygon constructed around the locations of five radio-tracked females, 21 animals were estimated to exist. They included the five radio-tracked, reproducing females and six adult males. Density estimates varied from one otter per 3.71–7.80 km of river length (one adult otter per 7.09–14.36 km) to one otter per 7.67–7.93 km2 of range, depending on the method and scale of analysis. Possible biases and implications of methods used for estimating density of otters and other organisms living in linear habitats are highlighted, providing recommendations on the issue.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model’s predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

	abstract = {Assessing anthropogenic effects on biological diversity, identifying drivers of human behavior, and motivating behavioral change are at the core of effective conservation. Yet knowledge of people's behaviors is often limited because the true extent of natural resource exploitation is difficult to ascertain, particularly if it is illegal. To obtain estimates of rule-breaking behavior, a technique has been developed with which to ask sensitive questions. We used this technique, unmatched-count technique (UCT), to provide estimates of bushmeat poaching, to determine motivation and seasonal and spatial distribution of poaching, and to characterize poaching households in the Serengeti. We also assessed the potential for survey biases on the basis of respondent perceptions of understanding, anonymity, and discomfort. Eighteen percent of households admitted to being involved in hunting. Illegal bushmeat hunting was more likely in households with seasonal or full-time employment, lower household size, and longer household residence in the village. The majority of respondents found the UCT questions easy to understand and were comfortable answering them. Our results suggest poaching remains widespread in the Serengeti and current alternative sources of income may not be sufficiently attractive to compete with the opportunities provided by hunting. We demonstrate that the UCT is well suited to investigating noncompliance in conservation because it reduces evasive responses, resulting in more accurate estimates, and is technically simple to apply. We suggest that the UCT could be more widely used, with the trade-off being the increased complexity of data analyses and requirement for large sample sizes.

The bacterium can be differentiated at the outer surface protein C ( ospC) locus into 25 genotypes. Wildlife hosts can be infected with a suite of ospC types but knowledge on the transmission efficiencies of these naturally infected hosts to ticks is still lacking. To evaluate the occupancy and detection of ospC types in wildlife hosts, we adapted a likelihood-based species patch occupancy model to test for the occurrence probabilities ( ψ - "occupancy") and transmission efficiencies ( ε - "detection") of each ospC type. We detected differences in ospC occurrence and transmission efficiencies from the null models with HIS (human invasive strains) types A and K having the highest occurrence estimates, but both HIS and non-HIS types having high transmission efficiencies. We also examined ospC frequency patterns with respect to strains known to be invasive in humans across the host species and phylogenetic groups. We found that shrews and to a lesser extent, birds, were important host groups supporting relatively greater frequencies of HIS to non-HIS types. This novel method of simultaneously assessing occurrence and transmission of ospC types provides a powerful tool in assessing disease risk at the genotypic level in naturally infected wildlife hosts and offers the opportunity to examine disease risk at the community level.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Bacterial communities migrate continuously from the drinking water treatment plant through the drinking water distribution system and into our built environment. Understanding bacterial dynamics in the distribution system is critical to ensuring that safe drinking water is being supplied to customers.Wepresent a 15-month survey of bacterial community dynam- ics in the drinking water system of Ann Arbor, MI. By sampling the water leaving the treatment plant and at nine points in the distribution system, we show that the bacterial community spatial dynamics of distance decay and dispersivity conform to the layout of the drinking water distribution system. However, the patterns in spatial dynamics were weaker than those for the tem- poral trends, which exhibited seasonal cycling correlating with temperature and source water use patterns and also demon- strated reproducibility on an annual time scale. The temporal trends were driven by two seasonal bacterial clusters consisting of multiple taxa with different networks of association within the larger drinking water bacterial community. Finally, we show that the Ann Arbor data set robustly conforms to previously described interspecific occupancy abundance models that link the rela- tive abundance of a taxon to the frequency of its detection. Relying on these insights, we propose a predictive framework for mi- crobial management in drinking water systems. Further, we recommend that long-term microbial observatories that collect high-resolution, spatially distributed, multiyear time series of community composition and environmental variables be estab- lished to enable the development and testing of the predictive framework. IMPORTANCE Safe and regulation-compliant drinking water may contain up to millions of microorganisms per liter, representing phylogenetically diverse groups of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya that affect public health, water infrastructure, and the aesthetic quality of water. The ability to predict the dynamics of the drinking water microbiome will ensure that microbial contamination risks can be better managed. Through a spatial-temporal survey of drinking water bacterial communities, we present novel in- sights into their spatial and temporal community dynamics and recommend steps to link these insights in a predictive frame- work for microbial management of drinking water systems. Such a predictive framework will not only help to eliminate micro- bial risks but also help to modify existing water quality monitoring efforts and make them more resource efficient. Further, a predictive framework for microbial management will be critical if we are to fully anticipate the risks and benefits of the beneficial manipulation of the drinking water microbiome.},

More people express concerns about spending time in the forest, because of the possibility of encountering bears, and acceptance for the bear is decreasing. In this context, reliable information about the bear's normal behaviour during bear-human encounters is important. Here we describe the behaviour of brown bears when encountering humans on foot. During 2006-2009, we approached 30 adult (21 females, 9 males) GPS-collared bears 169 times during midday, using 1-minute positioning before, during and after the approach. Observer movements were registered with a handheld GPS. The approaches started 869±348 m from the bears, with the wind towards the bear when passing it at approximately 50 m. The bears were detected in 15\% of the approaches, and none of the bears displayed any aggressive behaviour. Most bears (80\%) left the initial site during the approach, going away from the observers, whereas some remained at the initial site after being approached (20\%). Young bears left more often than older bears, possibly due to differences in experience, but the difference between ages decreased during the berry season compared to the pre-berry season. The flight initiation distance was longer for active bears (115±94 m) than passive bears (69±47 m), and was further affected by horizontal vegetation cover and the bear's age. Our findings show that bears try to avoid confrontations with humans on foot, and support the conclusions of earlier studies that the Scandinavian brown bear is normally not aggressive during encounters with humans.},

	abstract = {Metabolomics is the field of "-omics" research concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small low-molecular-weight metabolites in biological samples. In epidemiology, it represents an emerging technology and an unprecedented opportunity to measure environmental and other exposures with improved precision and far less measurement error than with standard epidemiologic methods. Advances in the application of metabolomics in large-scale epidemiologic research are now being realized through a combination of improved sample preparation and handling, automated laboratory and processing methods, and reduction in costs. The number of epidemiologic studies that use metabolic profiling is still limited, but it is fast gaining popularity in this area. In the present article, we present a roadmap for metabolomic analyses in epidemiologic studies and discuss the various challenges these data pose to large-scale studies. We discuss the steps of data preprocessing, univariate and multivariate data analysis, correction for multiplicity of comparisons with correlated data, and finally the steps of cross-validation and external validation. As data from metabolomic studies accumulate in epidemiology, there is a need for large-scale replication and synthesis of findings, increased availability of raw data, and a focus on good study design, all of which will highlight the potential clinical impact of metabolomics in this field.},

	abstract = {* Binary data are popular in ecological and environmental studies; however, due to various uncertainties and complexities present in data sets, the standard generalized linear model with a binomial error distribution often demonstrates insufficient predictive performance when analysing binary and proportional data. * To address this difficulty, we propose an asymmetric logistic regression model that uses a new parameter to account for data complexity. We observe that this parameter controls the model's asymmetry and is important for adjusting the weights associated with observed data in order to improve model fitting. This model includes the ordinary logistic regression model as a special case. It is easily implemented using a slight modification of glm or glmer in statistical software R. * Simulation studies suggest that our new approach outperforms a traditional approach in terms of both predictive accuracy and variable selection. In a case study involving fisheries data, we found that the annual catch amount had a greater impact on stock status prediction, and improved predictive capability was supported with a smaller AIC compared to a generalized linear model. * In summary, our method can enhance the applicability of a generalized linear model to various ecological problems using a slight modification, and significantly improves model fitting and model selection.},

	abstract = {Two statistical modelling techniques, generalized additive models (GAM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used to analyse relationships between the distributions of 15 freshwater fish species and their environment. GAM and MARS models were fitted individually for each species, and a MARS multiresponse model was fitted in which the distributions of all species were analysed simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using changes in deviance in the fitted models and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calculated using a bootstrap assessment procedure that simulates predictive performance for independent data. Results indicate little difference between the performance of GAM and MARS models, even when MARS models included interaction terms between predictor variables. Results from MARS models are much more easily incorporated into other analyses than those from GAM models. The strong performance of a MARS multiresponse model, particularly for species of low prevalence, suggests that it may have distinct advantages for the analysis of large datasets. Its identification of a parsimonious set of environmental correlates of community composition, coupled with its ability to robustly model species distributions in relation to those variables, can be seen as converging strongly with the purposes of traditional ordination techniques. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Predatory behavior of wolves (Canis lupus) was studied in 2 wolf territories in Scandinavia. We used hourly data from Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared adult wolves in combination with Geographic Information System (GIS) for detailed analyses of movement patterns. We tested the hypothesis that wolves spend 1-2 days close to larger prey such as moose (Alces alces) and reasoned that 1-2 locations per day would be enough to find all larger prey killed by the wolves. In total, the study period comprised 287 days and yielded 6,140 hourly GPS positions, with an average of 21.4 2.4 (SID) daily positions. Depending on the radius used to define clusters, 4,045-5,023 (65.9-81.8\%) positions were included in 622-741 GPS-clusters. We investigated all positions within clusters in the field, and 244 (22\%) single positions. In total, we found 68 moose and 4 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and classified them as wolf-killed within the study period. Another 10-15 moose may have been killed but not found. The GIS analyses indicated the proportion of wolf-killed ungulates included in GPS clusters to be strongly dependent on both number of positions per day and the radius used for defining a set of spatially aggregated GPS positions as a cluster. A higher proportion (78\%) of killed prey in clusters based on nighttime (2000-0700) than those based on daytime (0800-1900) positions (41\%). Simulation of aerial search during daylight hours for killed moose resulted in a serious underestimation ({\textgreater} 60\%) as compared to the number of wolf-killed moose found during the study. The average kill rate, corrected for 14\% nondetected moose, in the territories was 3.6-4.0 days per killed moose. We concluded that the feeding behavior of wolves in Scandinavia was either different from wolves preying on moose and living at the same latitude in North America, or that estimates of wolf kill rates on moose may have been seriously underestimated in previous North American studies.},

	abstract = {Scaling up from local, short-term experiments to larger-area and longer-term ones is crucial to address the role of scale in ecology. Few studies, however, examined large-scale spatial variability in the distribution and abundance of marine organisms, with rare attempts to directly compare spatial variation at local (centimetres-metres) vs. regional (1000's of kilometres) scale. Here, we used a hierarchical design to describe the spatial distribution of the hydroids epiphitic of the brown alga Cystoseira amentacea, a habitat-forming species that provides a continuous, extensive settling substrate at regional scale along the rocky coasts in the Mediterranean Sea. This continuity provides the potential to deal with scale-related variability, increasing area of investigation without adding differences deriving from habitat heterogeneity or changes in topographic complexity. Hydroids were selected for their abundance and for their life cycle features (rapid growth, small body size, early sexual or asexual reproduction and short life span), allowing rapid responses to changes in environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to analyse whether the structure of hydroid assemblages living on C. amentacea had a consistent pattern of variation among three portions of the algal thallus (i.e., basal, middle, and distal) across a spectrum of scales and whether having or not a pelagic stage could exert a significant influence on the distribution patterns of the species. A total of 32 species were identified. Multivariate analyses showed that hydroid colonization of Cystoseira occurs differently along each thallus, with patterns of variation in the structure of assemblages differing at an even smaller spatial scale than that of single plants. However, such differences varied from patch to patch. Among the 14 species identified as "important" to define the hydroid assemblage inhabiting Cystoseira, only one (Clytia hemisphaerica) has free medusae, the other species reproducing by fixed gonophores or by short-lived medusoids. Univariate analysis showed significant differences among portions of thalli in terms of spatial variability at the various scales investigated, thus suggesting that patterns of multivariate variation along the three portions of thalli might vary across scale. Overall, our results suggest that patterns of distribution of hydroids along C. amentacea thalli significantly vary across spatial scales but that the observed differences can be hardly interpreted on the basis of life-cycle patterns. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Data augmentation (DA) is a flexible tool for analyzing closed and open population models of capturerecapture data, especially models which include sources of hetereogeneity among individuals. The essential concept underlying DA, as we use the term, is based on adding observations to create a dataset composed of a known number of individuals. This new (augmented) dataset, which includes the unknown number of individuals N in the population, is then analyzed using a new model that includes a reformulation of the parameter N in the conventional model of the observed (unaugmented) data. In the context of capturerecapture models, we add a set of all zero encounter histories which are not, in practice, observable. The model of the augmented dataset is a zero-inflated version of either a binomial or a multinomial base model. Thus, our use of DA provides a general approach for analyzing both closed and open population models of all types. In doing so, this approach provides a unified framework for the analysis of a huge range of models that are treated as unrelated black boxes and named procedures in the classical literature. As a practical matter, analysis of the augmented dataset by MCMC is greatly simplified compared to other methods that require specialized algorithms. For example, complex capturerecapture models of an augmented dataset can be fitted with popular MCMC software packages (WinBUGS or JAGS) by providing a concise statement of the models assumptions that usually involves only a few lines of pseudocode. In this paper, we review the basic technical concepts of data augmentation, and we provide examples of analyses of closed-population models (M 0, M h , distance sampling, and spatial capturerecapture models) and open-population models (JollySeber) with individual effects.},

	abstract = {Increasing numbers of previously threatened large grazing birds (cranes, geese and swans) are causing crop damage along their flyways worldwide. For example, the number of reported incidents of crop damage caused by common cranes Grus grus, followed by regulated inspections and governmental compensation in Sweden, has increased over the last few decades and was valued at {\textasciitilde}200,000 Euros in 2012. Consequently, their impact on agriculture is escalating which raises the need for evidence-informed preventative strategies. We surveyed arable fields for autumn staging common cranes in an area surrounding a wetland reserve in Sweden. We assessed the following factors in relation to the probability of cranes being present on fields: crop stage, crop type, distance to roost site, time of day, field size and time since harvest. Stubble fields had the highest probability of crane presence, progressively decreasing through grassland and grazing grounds, bare soil to growing crop. A stubble field at 5. km from a roost site had a predicted probability (95\% CI) of hosting cranes of 0.25 (0.19-0.32). The probability of cranes visiting a field was linearly and negatively related to distance to the roost site. For example, the probability of crane presence increased from 0.05 (0.03-0.07) to 0.09 (0.06-0.15) when distance decreased from 5 to 1. km. At stubble fields, the probability of crane presence decreased with time since harvest and was highest for barley with progressively lower probability on wheat and oat. Illustrative scenario predictions developed from the models demonstrated that probability of crane presence could be high, 0.60 (0.42-0.77), if all favorable factors were combined (e.g. barley stubble, 1 day after harvest, 1. km from roost site). Given the existing framework of international conventions and prohibition of culling, there is a need for preventative strategies to reduce crop damage. Based on our results, such strategies should focus on providing cereal stubbles as diversionary fields, especially close to wetland roosting sites. Stubble field availability can be achieved by careful crop rotation planning. We suggest that crop rotation and time of harvest should be added to flyway management plans recently developed for some large grazing bird species to facilitate stable co-existence between conservation practices and agricultural interests.},

In this study, we developed a systematic environmental observation tool using methods borrowed from the field of systematic social observation. This tool, which employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was then used to identify environmental factors associated with the relative abundance of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in an inner-city neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada. Using a multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial model, we found that a variety of factors, including specific land use, building condition, and amount of refuse, were related to rat presence and abundance. Qualitative data largely supported and further clarified observed statistical relationships, but also identified conflicting and unique situations not easily captured through quantitative methods. Overall, the tool helped us to better understand the relationship between features of the urban environment and relative rat abundance within our study area and may useful for studying environmental determinants of zoonotic disease prevalence/distribution among urban rat populations in the future.},

Two different methods are available to estimate density: nonspatial capture-recapture models where the trap polygon is buffered with the half or full mean maximum distance moved by animals captured at more than 1 trap (1/2 MMDM or MMDM, respectively); or spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models that explicitly incorporate movement into the model. We used data from radiotracked Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the northwestern Swiss Alps (NWSA) during a low (1.0 lynx/100 km2) and a high (1.9-2.1 lynx/100 km2) lynx population density to test if lynx space use was density dependent. Second, we compared lynx density estimates resulting from these 2 different methods using camera-trapping data collected during winters 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 in the NWSA. Our results indicated lynx space use was negatively correlated with density. Lynx density estimates in all habitats using MMDM (0.86 and 0.97 lynx/100 km2 in winters 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively) were significantly lower than SCR model estimates, whereas there was no significant difference between SCR model (1.47 and 1.38) and 1/2 MMDM (1.37 and 1.51) density estimates. In the NWSA, which currently harbors the most abundant lynx population in Switzerland, 1/2 MMDM and SCR models provided more realistic lynx density estimates compared to the MMDM, which lies in the lower range of densities. Overall, the SCR model is preferable because it considers animal movements explicitly and is not biased by an informal estimation of the effective sampling area. © 2013 American Society of Mammalogists.},

Long-term studies are necessary to identify the effects of such temporal trends on biological and ecological phenomena; however, the collection of long-term data can be costly and time-consuming. * We investigated the effect of hydrological variation over time on population dynamics in a perennial river of the northern Chihuahuan Desert, using an imperilled freshwater mussel (Popenaias popeii) as a model. We conducted a 15-year mark-and-recapture study, and distance sampling, to estimate demographic parameters while accounting for habitat heterogeneity and changes in river discharge. * Recapture probability varied between microhabitats, and survival was positively correlated with river discharge. Survival and the finite rate of population growth were relatively stable over time. Over 60\% of individuals were found at relatively high density in riffle habitats, which compose c. 16\% of the total study area. * Mean monthly temperature in the region increased over the past 100 years, and mean monthly discharge of the Black River declined over the past 65 years. With no significant trends in total monthly precipitation, declines in discharge suggest that reduction of stream flow is likely due to lowering of the water table and decreased groundwater recharge. * Significant changes in climate and hydrological regimes, and increases in anthropogenic threats (increased water demand, degraded water quality) in the region, may induce significant declines in population size of this imperilled mussel. We demonstrated the importance of considering habitat heterogeneity and hydrological cycles over time to examine population dynamics. Survival of benthic invertebrates in desert streams is sensitive to hydrological cycles, which are expected to be altered via climate change and extensive water use. Species recovery plans need to incorporate knowledge of spatial distributions when designing strategies for habitat assessment and making conservation decisions.},

The spatial com- ponent of the studies has until recently, however, not been incorporated in statistical capture–recapture models. This paper reviews capture–recapture models that do include an explicit spatial component. This is done in a non-technical way, omitting much of the algebraic detail and focussing on the model formulation rather than on the estimation methods (which include inverse prediction, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods). One can view spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models as an endpoint of a series of spatial sampling models, starting with circular plot survey models and moving through conventional dis- tance sampling models, with and without measurement errors, through mark–recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models. This paper attempts a synthesis of these models in what I hope is a style accessible to non-specialists, placing SECR models in the context of other spatial sampling models.},

	abstract = {* Recent studies have demonstrated a need for increased rigour in building and evaluating ecological niche models (ENMs) based on presence-only occurrence data. Two major goals are to balance goodness-of-fit with model complexity (e.g. by ‘tuning’ model settings) and to evaluate models with spatially independent data. These issues are especially critical for data sets suffering from sampling bias, and for studies that require transferring models across space or time (e.g. responses to climate change or spread of invasive species). Efficient implementation of procedures to accomplish these goals, however, requires automation. * We developed ENMeval, an R package that: (i) creates data sets for k-fold cross-validation using one of several methods for partitioning occurrence data (including options for spatially independent partitions), (ii) builds a series of candidate models using Maxent with a variety of user-defined settings and (iii) provides multiple evaluation metrics to aid in selecting optimal model settings. The six methods for partitioning data are n−1 jackknife, random k-folds ( = bins), user-specified folds and three methods of masked geographically structured folds. ENMeval quantifies six evaluation metrics: the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot for test localities (AUCTEST), the difference between training and testing AUC (AUCDIFF), two different threshold-based omission rates for test localities and the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). * We demonstrate ENMeval by tuning model settings for eight tree species of the genus Coccoloba in Puerto Rico based on AICc. Evaluation metrics varied substantially across model settings, and models selected with AICc differed from default ones. * In summary, ENMeval facilitates the production of better ENMs and should promote future methodological research on many outstanding issues.},

Because detecting all individuals is most often impossible in free-ranging populations, estimation procedures have to account for a {\textless}1 detection probability. Capture–recapture methods allow biologists to cope with this issue of detectability. Nevertheless, capture–recapture models for open populations are built on the assumption that all individuals share the same detection probability, although detection heterogeneity among individuals has led to underestimating abundance of closed populations. We developed multievent capture–recapture models for an open population and proposed an associated estimator of population size that both account for individual detection heterogeneity (IDH). We considered a two-class mixture model with weakly and highly detectable individuals to account for IDH. In a noninvasive capture–recapture study of wolves we based on genotypes identified in feces and hairs, we found a large underestimation of population size (27\% on average) occurred when IDH was ignored.},

	abstract = {1. The effect of selective exploitation of certain age, stage or sex classes (e.g., trophy hunting) on population dynamics is relatively well studied in fisheries and sexually dimorphic mammals. 2. Harvesting of terrestrial species with no morphological differences visible between the different age and sex classes (monomorphic species) is usually assumed to be nonselective because monomorphicity makes intentionally selective harvesting pointless and impractical. But harvesting of the red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus), a monomorphic species, was recently shown to be unintentionally selective. This study uses a sex- and age-specific model to explore the previously unresearched effects of unintentional harvesting selectivity. 3. We examine the effects of selectivity on red grouse dynamics by considering models with and without selectivity. Our models include territoriality and parasitism, two mechanisms known to be important for grouse dynamics. 4. We show that the unintentional selectivity of harvesting that occurs in red grouse decreases population yield compared with unselective harvesting at high harvest rates. Selectivity also dramatically increases extinction risk at high harvest rates. 5. Selective harvesting strengthens the 3- to 13-year red grouse population cycle, suggesting that the selectivity of harvesting is a previously unappreciated factor contributing to the cycle. 6. The additional extinction risk introduced by harvesting selectivity provides a quantitative justification for typically implemented 20-40\% harvest rates, which are below the maximum sustainable yield that could be taken, given the observed population growth rates of red grouse. 7. This study shows the possible broad importance of investigating in future research whether unintentionally selective harvesting occurs on other species.},

	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

Sampling was conducted at three spatial scales (grains), from a single point up to the scale of several square metres. Twenty-three functional traits, related to the structure of the shoot and root systems and to nutrient status, were measured on each species present, separately in each community. 2.?Patterns of association between plant species were compared with those expected under a null model, to assess whether plants with similar functional traits tended to coexist or to separate, i.e. whether there was environmental filtering or limiting similarity. A patch null model was used, a type that tends to be conservative but that avoids spurious evidence of limiting similarity caused by environmental pseudoreplication. One overall and four univariate test statistics were calculated, to capture possible patterns in trait space whilst minimising the problem of multiple testing. 3.?In the Shrub community, overall evidence for even spacing of co-occurring species in functional-trait space, the pattern expected from the theory of limiting similarity, was seen at the area scale. In univariate tests in that community, there was evidence for even spacing in leaf lobation and leaf succulence, especially at small scales. 4.?In the Rush community, there was significant evidence for limiting similarity in several traits, especially those related to canopy interactions, but also in some root characteristics. However, clustering in other traits, presumably owing to microenvironmental filtering, reduced overall tests for limiting similarity to ?marginal significance? (0.1 {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} 0.05). 5.?In the species-poor and salt-stressed Salt turf, significant departures from the null model were sporadic and not consistent, although chlorophyll characters and leaf nitrogen concentration tended to be clustered. 6.?Synthesis:?There was evidence for niche limitation in two of the communities ? Rush and Shrub ? apparently based on canopy interactions in both cases and perhaps also root interactions in the latter community. Limiting similarity can be an important force in community assembly. However, in situations when it cannot be demonstrated, we do not know whether trait-based competition is absent or whether its signal is overwhelmed by other processes.},

However, their respective potential distributions have not yet been studied at a large scale. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of climatic and host factors on the geographical distributions of both Tomicus species in Europe and around the Mediterranean Sea, and to establish maps of suitable areas. * 2Using 114 published localities where the presence or absence of both species was unambiguously recorded, we gathered WorldClim meteorological records to correlate the occurrence of insects with bioclimatic variables and to build potential distribution maps. * 3The two studied Tomicus species presented parapatric distributions and opposite climate demands, with T. destruens occurring in locations with warmer temperatures, whereas T. piniperda occurs under a colder climate. Amongst the investigated climate variables, temperature appeared to be most correlated with both species distributions. * 4The potential ranges of both species were further restricted by the availability of pine hosts. It appeared that setting new pine plantations in regions where T. destruens or T. piniperda are still absent could favour a rapid expansion of their distributions.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We developed a statistical model to estimate the abundances of potentially interacting species encountered while conducting point-count surveys at a set of ecologically relevant locations – as in a metacommunity of species. In the model we assume that abundances of species with similar traits (e.g., body size) are potentially correlated and that these correlations, when present, may exist among all species or only among functionally related species (such as members of the same foraging guild). We also assume that species-specific abundances vary among locations owing to systematic and stochastic sources of heterogeneity. For example, if abundances differ among locations due to differences in habitat, then measures of habitat may be included in the model as covariates. Naturally, the quantitative effects of these covariates are assumed to differ among species. Our model also accounts for the effects of detectability on the observed counts of each species. This aspect of the model is especially important for rare or uncommon species that may be difficult to detect in community-level surveys. Estimating the detectability of each species requires sampling locations to be surveyed repeatedly using different observers or different visits of a single observer. As an illustration, we fitted models to species-specific counts of birds obtained while sampling an avian community during the breeding season. In the analysis we examined whether species abundances appeared to be correlated due to similarities in morphological measures (body mass, beak length, tarsus length, wing length, tail length) and whether these correlations existed among all species or only among species of the same foraging guild. We also used the model to estimate the effects of forested area on species abundances and the effects of sound power output (as measured by body size) on species detection probabilities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The implementation of intensive and complex approaches to monitor large carnivores is resource demanding, restricted to endangered species, small populations, or small distribution ranges. Wolf monitoring over large spatial scales is difficult, but the management of such contentious species requires regular estimations of abundance to guide decision-makers. The integration of wolf marking behaviour with simple sign counts may offer a cost-effective alternative to monitor the status of wolf populations over large spatial scales. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a multi-sampling approach, based on the collection of visual and scent wolf marks (faeces and ground scratching) and the assessment of wolf reproduction using howling and observation points, to test whether the intensity of marking behaviour around the pup-rearing period (summer-autumn) could reflect wolf reproduction. Between 1994 and 2007 we collected 1,964 wolf marks in a total of 1,877 km surveyed and we searched for the pups' presence (1,497 howling and 307 observations points) in 42 sampling sites with a regular presence of wolves (120 sampling sites/year). The number of wolf marks was ca. 3 times higher in sites with a confirmed presence of pups (20.3 vs. 7.2 marks). We found a significant relationship between the number of wolf marks (mean and maximum relative abundance index) and the probability of wolf reproduction. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This research establishes a real-time relationship between the intensity of wolf marking behaviour and wolf reproduction. We suggest a conservative cutting point of 0.60 for the probability of wolf reproduction to monitor wolves on a regional scale combined with the use of the mean relative abundance index of wolf marks in a given area. We show how the integration of wolf behaviour with simple sampling procedures permit rapid, real-time, and cost-effective assessments of the breeding status of wolf packs with substantial implications to monitor wolves at large spatial scales.},

Direct mark–resight estimation of a given number of individuals (N) is considered first, where the probability of observing an individual in the population is estimated from observation rates of radio-marked individuals that are present in the population. Second, the chapter discusses the use of sight ability models developed from radio-marked animals, where trials are conducted to estimate the probability of sighting given that the radio-marked animal is present on a survey unit. Covariates, such as size of the group of animals containing the radio-marked individual at the time of the survey or the percent vegetation cover of the animal's location during the survey, are used to develop models that predict the probability of sighting individuals in the population. Finally, the chapter considers how radio-marked animals can resolve the issue of estimating animal density from a trapping grid of size A with N individuals estimated from mark–recapture methods. By radio-marking a sample of individuals captured on the grid and tracking them shortly after the grid trapping procedure is finished, the proportion of their locations that occurs on the former trapping grid can be used to correct the bias of the naive estimate of density.},

We tested for signatures of assembly rules in the distribution of species' traits in Pacific rockfish (Sebastes spp.) assemblages. We used morphology, dietary niche (estimated with stable nitrogen isotopes), and distribution data to identify traits that relate to local-scale resource use (the alpha-niche) and to environmental gradients (the beta-niche). We showed that gill raker morphology was related to trophic position (an alpha-niche axis), while relative eye size was associated with depth habitat (a beta-niche axis). We therefore hypothesized that, within assemblages of coexisting rockfish species, the gill raker trait would be overdispersed (evenly spaced) due to limiting similarity, while relative eye size would be clustered due to environmental filtering. We examined the evolutionary relatedness of coexisting species to ask whether phylogenetic community structure and trait distributions gave similar indications about the roles of assembly processes. We tested the trait distributions and phylogenetic structure of 30 published rockfish assemblages against a null model of random community assembly. As predicted, the gill raker trait tended to be more evenly spaced than expected by chance, as did overall body size, while relative eye size was more clustered than expected. Phylogenetic community structure appeared to reflect historical dispersal and speciation and did not provide consistent support for assembly rules. Our results indicate that rockfish community assembly is nonrandom with regard to species' traits and show how distinguishing traits related to the alpha- and beta-niches and incorporating functional morphology can provide for powerful tests of assembly rules.},

This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

	abstract = {1. Abundance is a key quantity for conservation and management strategies but remains challenging to assess in the field. Capture–recapture (CR) methods are often used to estimate abundance while correcting for imperfect detection, but these methods are costly. Occupancy, sometimes considered as a surrogate for abundance, is estimated through the collection of presence/absence data and is less costly while allowing gathering of information at a large spatial scale. 2. Building on the recent pieces of work on the combination of different data sources, we showed how abundance data can be complemented by presence/absence data and can be analysed conjointly to improve abundance estimates. Our approach relies on a hierarchical model that makes explicit the link between the abundance and occupancy state variables while formally accounting for imperfect detection. 3. We used a population of Eurasian lynx in France monitored via camera traps and a col- lection of presence signs as an illustration of our approach. 4. Synthesis and applications. We combined capture–recapture and occupancy data and dem- onstrated that we can efficiently improve abundance estimates. Our method can be used by managers when estimates of trends in abundance lack power due to sparse data collected dur- ing an intensive survey, by simply integrating data collected during non-systematic survey. Furthermore, combining these two sampling procedures makes full use of all available data and allows the development of conservation and management strategies based on precise abundance estimates. Overall, the combination of different data sources in an integrated sta- tistical framework has great potential, especially for elusive species.},

Although this technique provides only an estimate of the animal’s true position, most authors do not report the error associated with the radio-telemetry location. We show the results of estimating error in a radio-telemetry study of roe deer in a hilly environment in central Italy. Ten VHF radio-collars were hidden in the study area by an external field operator and five field workers involved in the collection of the data were asked to locate the transmitters. The position of the radio-collars was changed three times, thus generating thirty different locations. Radio-locations were obtained using standard triangulation from settled receiving stations. We estimated linear and angular errors associated with the radio-telemetry technique, we tested the experience effect of the filed workers and the topography effect of the study area on linear and angular errors. Furthermore, we quantified the proportion of estimated locations not correctly associated with the habitat types. The mean linear and angular errors were respectively 42.9 m and 12.6°. For both linear and angular errors, no differences were detected among field operators and between the expert and not expert field operators. The linear error was strongly related to the angular error and to the mean distance between the transmitter and the receiving stations. The angular error was negatively related to the slope of transmitters. The assignation of an erroneous habitat occurred on 22.7\% of the times. This study is aimed to emphasize the importance of reporting radio-telemetry error in studies were triangulation technique is used.},

	abstract = {Numerous techniques have been proposed to estimate carnivore abundance and density, but few have been validated against populations of known size. We used a density estimate established by intensive monitoring of a population of radiotagged leopards (Panthera pardus) with a detection probability of 1.0 to evaluate efficacy of track counts and camera-trap surveys as population estimators. We calculated densities from track counts using 2 methods and compared performance of 10 methods for calculating the effectively sampled area for camera-trapping data. Compared to our reference density (7.33 [plus or minus] 60.44 leopards/100 km2), camera-trapping generally produced more accurate but less precise estimates than did track counts. The most accurate result (6.97 [plus or minus] 61.88 leopards/ 100 km2) came from camera-trap data with a sampled area buffered by a boundary strip representing the mean maximum distance moved by leopards outside the survey area (MMDMOSA) established by telemetry. However, contrary to recent suggestions, the traditional method of using half the mean maximum distance moved from photographic recaptures did not result in gross overestimates of population density (6.56 [plus or minus] 61.92 leopards/100 km2) but rather displayed the next best performance after MMDMOSA. The only track-count method comparable to reference density employed a capture-recapture framework applied to data when individuals were identified from their tracks (6.45 [plus or minus] 61.43 leopards/ 100 km2) but the underlying assumptions of this technique limit more widespread application. Our results demonstrate that if applied correctly, camera-trap surveys represent the best balance of rigor and cost-effectiveness for estimating abundance and density of cryptic carnivore species that can be identified individually.

In many applications there is reason to question independence, for example when species display territorial behavior. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model which allows for dependence between locations to account for avoidance or territorial behavior. We show via a simulation study that accounting for this can improve population size estimates. The method is illustrated using a case study of small mammal trapping data to estimate avoidance and population density of adult female field voles (Microtus agrestis) in northern England.},

Here, we highlight the many direct and indirect impacts of tabanids and provide a brief summary of tabanid morphology, biology, and life cycle. Impacts include pathogen transmission, parasite transportation (Dermatobia hominis), biological transmission (Loa loa), and mechanical transmission of viruses, such as equine infectious anemia virus, protozoa, such as Trypanosoma evansi and Besnotia besnoiti, and bacteria, such as Bacillus anthracis and Anaplasma marginale. We discuss parameters of mechanical transmission and its mathematical modeling. Control methods for tabanid populations are also summarized; these include trapping, the use of insecticides, repellents, and livestock protection.

The need for temporal replication at sampled sites to estimate detection probability creates a trade-off between spatial replication (number of sample sites distributed within the area of interest/inference) and temporal replication (number of repeated surveys at each site). Here, we discuss a suite of questions commonly encountered during the design phase of occupancy studies, and we describe software (program GENPRES) developed to allow investigators to easily explore design trade-offs focused on particularities of their study system and sampling limitations.

	abstract = {The behavioral patterns and large territories of large carnivores make them challenging to monitor. Occupancy modeling provides a framework for monitoring population dynamics and distribution of territorial carnivores. We combined data from hunter surveys, howling and sign surveys conducted at predicted wolf rendezvous sites, and locations of radiocollared wolves to model occupancy and estimate the number of gray wolf (Canis lupus) packs and individuals in Idaho during 2009 and 2010. We explicitly accounted for potential misidentification of occupied cells (i.e., false positives) using an extension of the multi-state occupancy framework. We found agreement between model predictions and distribution and estimates of number of wolf packs and individual wolves reported by Idaho Department of Fish and Game and Nez Perce Tribe from intensive radiotelemetry-based monitoring. Estimates of individual wolves from occupancy models that excluded data from radiocollared wolves were within an average of 12.0\% (SD=6.0) of existing statewide minimum counts. Models using only hunter survey data generally estimated the lowest abundance, whereas models using all data generally provided the highest estimates of abundance, although only marginally higher. Precision across approaches ranged from 14\% to 28\% of mean estimates and models that used all data streams generally provided the most precise estimates. We demonstrated that an occupancy model based on different survey methods can yield estimates of the number and distribution of wolf packs and individual wolf abundance with reasonable measures of precision. Assumptions of the approach including that average territory size is known, average pack size is known, and territories do not overlap, must be evaluated periodically using independent field data to ensure occupancy estimates remain reliable. Use of multiple survey methods helps to ensure that occupancy estimates are robust to weaknesses or changes in any 1 survey method. Occupancy modeling may be useful for standardizing estimates across large landscapes, even if survey methods differ across regions, allowing for inferences about broad-scale population dynamics of wolves.

	abstract = {The European wildcat is an elusive felid that is declining across its range. Sicily hosts a distinctive insular wildcat population, the conservation of which requires much better ecological knowledge than is currently available, particularly popu- lation density. We simultaneously used two noninvasive methods (camera- trapping and scat-collection) to estimate the population density of wildcats on the Etna volcano. We conducted genetic analyses to identify individuals and to detect potential hybridization with the domestic cat. We analyzed individual capture- histories from camera-trapping and scat-collection using the spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model. Furthermore, we applied the random encounter model (REM), which does not require individual identification, to the camera- trapping data. We identified 14 wildcats from 70 photographic detections (6.48 detections/100 trap-days) obtained from 1080 camera-trapping days over 4 months, and we estimated to have identified all the individuals living in the study area (10.9 km−2 ). On the contrary, we identified 10 wildcats from 14 out of 39 scats collected from 391 km of transects walked. The estimated densities (individ- uals km−2 ± se) were 0.32 ± 0.1 (SECR camera-trapping), 1.36 ± 0.73 (SECR scat- collection) and 0.39 ± 0.03 (REM). The population density estimates obtained from SECR camera-trapping andREMoverlapped, although we recommend care when applying the latter. The SECR scat-collection gave the highest population density (and less precise) estimates because of the low number of capture and recaptures; however, the population size estimated with this method matched the number of individuals photographed. The population density of the wildcat in Etna falls in the medium-high range of those reported in literature, highlighting the role of this ecosystem for the long-term conservation of the wildcat in Sicily. Camera-trapping is confirmed as a useful tool to assess the wildcat population density and, in this case, was complemented by the genetic analysis that confirmed individual identity.},

Linear and nonlinear regression methods are often applied in the basic sciences. Clinical studies that evaluate the relative contribution of various factors to a single binary outcome, such as the presence or absence of death or disease, most often employ the method of logistic regression. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction sufficient to permit clini- cians who are unfamiliar with regression methodology to understand and interpret its results. We will begin by describing linear regression techniques in order to present basic concepts. We will then consider logistic regression at greater length because of its importance and increasing use by cardiothoracic surgeons. The calculations involved in logistic regression are complex, but currently available personal computers and ubiquitous statistical software have brought the capabil- ity for performing the analysis to the desktop of virtually all clinicians. Consequently, one can hardly find a recent medical journal that does not include at least one report that employs this technique. Figure 1 illustrates the increasing use of logistic regression in studies appearing in three thoracic surgical journals during the last decade. After a description of logistic regression, we will present a clinical example illustrating the technique. Simple},

Movement is crucial to select habitats but the landscape structure influences the movement patterns of animals. Characterising the movement characteristics, utilisation distribution (UD) and habitat selection of a single species in different landscapes can provide important insights into species response to changes in the landscape. We investigate these three fields in female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in southern Sweden, in order to understand how landscape structure influences their movement and feeding patterns. Movements are compared between two regions, one dominated by a fragmented agriculture–forest mosaic and the other by managed homogenous forest. Red deer in the agriculturedominated landscape had larger UDs compared to those in the forest-dominated area, moved larger distances between feeding and resting and left cover later in the day but used a similar duration for their movements, suggesting faster travelling speeds between resting and feeding locations. The habitat selection patterns of red deer indicate a trade-off between forage and cover, selecting for habitats that provide shelter during the day and forage by night. However, the level of trade-off, mediated through movement and space use patterns, is influenced by the landscape structure. Our approach provides further understanding of the link between individual animal space use and changing landscapes and can be applied to many species able to carry tracking devices.},

	abstract = {The importance of commensal microbes for human health is increasingly recognized, yet the impacts of evolutionary changes in human diet and culture on commensal microbiota remain almost unknown. Two of the greatest dietary shifts in human evolution involved the adoption of carbohydrate-rich Neolithic (farming) diets (beginning ∼10,000 years before the present) and the more recent advent of industrially processed flour and sugar (in ∼1850). Here, we show that calcified dental plaque (dental calculus) on ancient teeth preserves a detailed genetic record throughout this period. Data from 34 early European skeletons indicate that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farming shifted the oral microbial community to a disease-associated configuration. The composition of oral microbiota remained unexpectedly constant between Neolithic and medieval times, after which (the now ubiquitous) cariogenic bacteria became dominant, apparently during the Industrial Revolution. Modern oral microbiotic ecosystems are markedly less diverse than historic populations, which might be contributing to chronic oral (and other) disease in postindustrial lifestyles.},

	abstract = {In the last two centuries, persecution and defores- tation caused grey wolf Canis lupus populations in Europe to decline. Recently, their numbers started to recover although most populations still remain isolated from one another. This study presents the first documented evidence of the successful reconnection of the Dinaric-Balkan and the Alpine wolf pop- ulations via long-distance dispersal and subsequent reproduc- tion. A young male wolf radiocollared in the Dinaric Mountains in July 2011 travelled through Slovenia and Austria to the Italian Alps, where he settled in March 2012. During the 98 days of dispersal period, the wolf has travelled a cumulative line distance of 1176 km crossing multiple anthro- pogenic and natural barriers, and successfully hunting wild prey until he settled 233kmstraight line distance fromits natal territory. Camera trapping, snow tracking and genetic evi- dence in the new territory confirmed pairing with a female wolf from the neighbouring Alpine population. In the follow- ing year, the pair has produced a first documented Bmixed{\textasciicircum} litter between wolves from the Dinaric-Balkan and the Alpine wolf populations. This case study demonstrates the potential for the future merging of European wolf populations even in human-dominated landscapes and highlights the importance of transboundary cooperation in wolf research and management.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of wildlife population size is central to effective management and conservation but is notoriously difficult for rare and cryptic carnivores. Mark–recapture methods can reliably estimate the abundance of large carnivores but are sensitive to departures from the assumption of equal catchability, which is probable for territorial and social carnivores. We empirically analysed how pride area, age and sex, group size and pride size of lions Panthera leo and possession of a kill affect the performance of the sight–resight method relative to concurrent total counts. We stratified the population by pride area to obtain a better sample size for reliable population size estimation, and determined the composition and size of each pride. Marking and recapture involved merely identifying and re- identifying individual lions. The per cent of the population marked in each pride area varied from 33.3 to 100. Twenty-six estimates of pride size for 22 different pride areas and repeat surveys in five pride areas were made between September 1990 and April 1992. The second samples involved sampling with replacement, so Bailey’s (1952) bias-corrected estimator for closed populations was applied. Increasing the per cent of the population marked improved accuracy only when the number of lions marked in a pride area was at least seven. Estimates were somewhat poorer when the number marked was less than seven but improved with more markings, but no estimate of population size was biased high. Age, sex, group size, pride size and feeding events all influenced the sightability of lions. Notably, females (41 year) were sighted or resighted in proportion to their presence in the population, whereas similarly aged males, adults or subadults fluctuated erratically about their population proportions. Sight–resight surveys of territorial and social carnivores are reliable but can be costly and time consuming.},

Such information can be used to evaluate various types of population control to ensure that the most cost-effective damage-abatement methods are used. We developed a sex-and age-structured model to simulate general population dynamics of Wild Pigs in Texas. Our objectives were to estimate potential statewide Wild Pig population-growth rates for Texas, identify model parameters that most influenced population trajectories, and compare resulting model predictions with ancillary population-trend data. Our Wild Pig simulation model estimated a mean annual growth rate of 0.32 (SE = 0.01), and stochastic model projections of Wild Pig population sizes ranged from 3.6 million to 16.9 million after 5 years. To evaluate parameter sensitivity, we recast our simulation results into a Bayesian belief network, and evaluated input-parameter influence based on variance reduction using Shannon's measure of mutual information. Our results indicated that the most influential model parameters within our simulation were number of litters per female and number of piglets recruited into the population, while adult and juvenile survival had little influence on Wild Pig population size within our simulations. Overall, our results suggest that natural resource managers should focus efforts towards reducing Wild Pig reproductive success, as opposed to attempting to increase adult mortality, when conducting Wild Pig population-control campaigns.},

Probability of detection is a decreasing function of distance from the home range center, with one parameter for magnitude and another for spatial scale. Sex-based and other differences in home range size potentially cause heterogeneity in individual detection and bias in estimates of density. The two parameters of detection have hitherto been treated as independent, but we suggest that an inverse relation is expected when detection probability depends on time spent near the detector. Variation in the spatial scale of detection is then compensated by reciprocal variation in the magnitude parameter. We define a net measure of detection (‘‘single-detector sampling area,’’ a0), and show by simulation that its coefficient of variation (CV) is a better predictor of bias than the CV of either component or the sum of their squared CVs. In an example using the grizzly bear Ursus arctos, the estimated sex variation in a0 was small despite large variation in each component. From the simulations, the relative bias of density estimates was generally negligible (,5\%) when CV(a0) , 30\%. Parameterization of the detection model in terms of a0 and spatial scale can be more parsimonious and significantly aids the biological interpretation of detection parameters.},

Although simulations provide valuable information about the behaviour of different methods, they are likely to be too simplistic to be able to completely predict the outcome with real data. We used post-fire vegetation succession data to compare four commonly used ordination techniques: CA (correspondence analysis), DCA (detrended correspondence analysis), PCoA (principal coordinates analysis), and NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling). Fire intensity was used as a method- independent criterion for comparing the performance of the different methods. Solutions produced by these methods were compared using Procrustean analysis. According to our results, the compared ordination techniques presented different aspects of the multidimensional species space. In general, metric scaling methods, particularly CA and DCA, were far better in reflecting the main gradient in numerical terms, as compared with NMDS. In contrast, non-metric scaling out-performed metric scaling in graphical terms. We conclude that none of the compared methods is perfect in reflecting a complex vegetation gradient. Also, the difference in their abilities makes it difficult to point out the most suitable method for our data.},

	abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts like wildlife-vehicle collisions pose major challenges for the management and conservation of mobile wildlife in human-dominated landscapes, particularly when large species are involved. Mitigation measures to reduce risk of collisions may be based on information given by wildlife movement and collision data. To test whether movement and collision data indicate different spatiotemporal risk zones, we predicted year-around probabilities of road-crossings of GPS-marked female moose (Alces alces) (n= 102), and compared them with spatiotemporal patterns of police recorded moose-vehicle collisions (n= 1158). Probability of moose road-crossings peaked in May, June, and between mid November and the beginning of January, i.e. during moose migration. Moose-vehicle collisions were more likely during autumn and winter. Comparing environmental attributes of crossing and collision sites showed significant differences. The likelihood of collisions increased with the abundance of human-modified areas and higher allowed speed, and was lower on forest roads. We found that animal movement data alone are insufficient to predict collision risk zones, while analyses of collision data alone overestimate the collision risk in certain habitats. Our findings suggest that higher collision risk is largely due to low light and poor road surface conditions rather than to more animal road-crossings. This suggests that efforts to reduce wildlife collisions should focus on driver attitudes and road conditions rather than animal movement, and any efforts to model the collision risk will require actual collision data, and not just movement data. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the central California coastal forests, a newly discovered virulent pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum) has killed hundreds of thousands of native oak trees. Predicting the potential distribution of the disease in California remains an urgent demand of regulators and scientists. Most methods used to map potential ranges of species (e.g. multivariate or logistic regression) require both presence and absence data, the latter of which are not always feasibly collected, and thus the methods often require the generation of 'pseudo' absence data. Other methods (e.g. BIOCLIM and DOMAIN) seek to model the presence-only data directly. In this study, we present alternative methods to conventional approaches to modeling by developing support vector machines (SVMs), which are the new generation of machine learning algorithms used to find optimal separability between classes within datasets, to predict the potential distribution of Sudden Oak Death in California. We compared the performances of two types of SVMs models: two-class SVMs with 'pseudo' absence data and one-class SVMs. Both models performed well. The one-class SVMs have a slightly better true-positive rate (0.9272 ± 0.0460 S.D.) than the two-class SVMs (0.9105 ± 0.0712 S.D.). However, the area predicted to be at risk for the disease using the one-class SVMs (18,441 km 2) is much larger than that of the two-class SVMs (13,828 km 2). Both models show that the majority of disease risk will occur in coastal areas. Compared with the results of two-class SVMs, the one-class SVMs predict a potential risk in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges; much greater risks are also found in Los Angles and Humboldt Counties. We believe the support vector machines when coupled with geographic information system (GIS) will be a useful method to deal with presence-only data in ecological analysis over a range of scales. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Camera traps have become the main method for estimating jaguar (Panthera onca) densities. Over 74 studies have been carried out throughout the species range following standard design recommendations. We reviewed the study designs used by these studies and the results obtained. Using simulated data we evaluated the performance of different statistical methods for estimating density from camera trap data including the closed-population capture-recapture models Mo and Mh with a buffer of 1/2 and the full mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models under different study designs and scenarios. We found that for the studies reviewed density estimates were negatively correlated with camera polygon size and MMDM estimates were positively correlated. The simulations showed that for camera polygons that were smaller than approximately one home range density estimates for all methods had a positive bias. For large polygons the Mh MMDM and SECR model produced the most accurate results and elongated polygons can improve estimates with the SECR model. When encounter rates and home range sizes varied by sex, estimates had a negative bias for models that did not include sex as a covariate. Based on the simulations we concluded that the majority of jaguar camera trap studies did not meet the requirements necessary to produce unbiased density estimates and likely overestimated true densities. We make clear recommendations for future study designs with respect to camera layout, number of cameras, study length, and camera placement. Our findings directly apply to camera trap studies of other large carnivores. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Counting animals to estimate their population sizes is often essential for their management and conservation. Since practitioners frequently rely on indirect observations of animals, it is important to better understand the relationship between such indirect indices and animal abundance. The Formozov-Malyshev-Pereleshin (FMP) formula provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between animal track counts and the true density of species. Although this analytical method potentially has universal applicability wherever animals are readily detectable by their tracks, it has long been unique to Russia and remains widely underappreciated. In this paper, we provide a test of the FMP formula by isolating the influence of animal travel path tortuosity (i.e., convolutedness) on track counts. We employed simulations using virtual and empirical data, in addition to a field test comparing FMP estimates with independent estimates from line transect distance sampling. We verify that track counts (total intersections between animals and transects) are determined entirely by density and daily movement distances. Hence, the FMP estimator is theoretically robust against potential biases from specific shapes or patterns of animal movement paths if transects are randomly situated with respect to those movements (i.e., the transects do not influence animals' movements). However, detectability (the detection probability of individual animals) is not determined simply by daily travel distance but also by tortuosity, so ensuring that all intersections with transects are counted regardless of the number of individual animals that made them becomes critical for an accurate density estimate. Additionally, although tortuosity has no bearing on mean track encounter rates, it does affect encounter rate variance and therefore estimate precision. We discuss how these fundamental principles made explicit by the FMP formula have widespread implications for methods of assessing animal abundance that rely on indirect observations.},

	abstract = {Placing external monitoring devices onto seabirds can have deleterious effects on welfare and performance, and even the most benign marking and identification methods return sparse population data at a huge time and effort cost. Consequently, there is growing interest in methods that minimise disturbance but still allow robust population monitoring. We have developed a computer vision system that automatically creates a unique biometric identifier for individual adult African penguins Spheniscus demersus using natural markings in the chest plumage and matches this against a population database. We tested this non-invasive system in the field at Robben Island, South Africa. False individual identifications of detected penguins occurred in less than 1 in 10 000 comparisons (n = 73 600, genuine acceptance rate = 96.7\%) to known individuals. The monitoring capacity in the field was estimated to be above 13\% of the birds that passed a camera (n = 1453). A significant increase in this lower bound was recorded under favourable conditions. We conclude that the system is suitable for population monitoring of this species: the demonstrated sensitivity is comparable to computer-aided animal biometric monitoring systems in the literature. A full deployment of the system would identify more penguins than is possible with a complete exploitation of the current levels of flipper banding at Robben Island. Our study illustrates the potential of fully-automated, non-invasive, complete population monitoring of wild animals.},

The integration of movement ecology and habitat selection can greatly augment the applicability and scope of both disciplines, and we explore the issues that arise from integration, because of the differing data types and methods used by each approach. 3. We propose an adaptable methodological framework which can be used to combine movement ecology and habitat selection when using data from GPS tracking devices, whether from human or animal foragers. The methodology is based on three steps and can be implemented in the free downloadable statistical program R, using the full code in the Data S1. 4. First, we show that net squared displacement, coupled with nonlinear mixed-effects models, is suitable for quantifying characteristics of small-scale movement, such as daily travel patterns, and extracting parts of these journeys for analysis. 5. Secondly, having extracted part of a journey, biased random bridges use the auto-correlated GIS tracking data to create a utilization distribution (UD) for each individual. This method includes movement between known locations to estimate use intensity in an area. 6. Finally, the UD can be analysed by a resource utilization function which relates the intensity of use to landscape features of an area to identify habitats selected by an individual. This can be used to predict use of the landscape at larger scales for both individuals and an entire population. 7. This methodological framework is a flexible method to accurately assess human and animal resource use and movement through the natural environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Accurate density and population estimates are needed to manage bear populations but are difficult to obtain. Most such estimates reported for bears are largely subjective and lack estimates of precision. Fifteen brown bear (Ursus arctos) and 3black bear (U. americanus) density estimates were obtainein Alaska during 1985 through 1992 using 2-9 replicates of capture-mark-resight (CMR) techniques in 17 different areas. Our studies used radiotelemetry to document movements of marked animals into and from search areas. This pro- cedure essentially eliminated the need to correct density estimates for edge or periphery effects caused by absence of geographic closure. To estimate population size, we used a maximum-likelihood estimator modified to accommodate temporary movements of marked animals into and from our search areas. Our approach permitted direct calculations of density from our population estimates. Our procedures provided density esti- mates that were repeatable, were comparable among areas, included estimates of precision, and were more objective than methods historically used to estimate bear abundance. Our density estimation procedures have widespread applicability for other wildlife studies using radiotelemetry. Our estimates were obtained within a wide spectrum of habitats and provided a range of Alaskan densities from 10.1 to 551 brown bears (all ages)/1,000 km2 and from 89 to 289 black bears (all ages)/1,000 km2. Our highest brown bear density is probably near the maximum for this species, but areas with lower densities (3.9/1,000 km2) have been reported in Alaska. Areas with black bear densities higher than in our study areas probably occur in Alaska. Brown bear densities were 6-80 times greater in coastal areas where abundant runs of multiple species of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) were available to bears than in interior areas. Our CMR technique provided useful data for bear population management and impact assessments and has potential for application to other species and areas.},

While such evidence can be useful for basic studies, using remotely-triggered camera traps offer researchers more reliable evidence of animal presence and, with appropriate study design and analysis, provides an array of opportunities to investigate carnivore ecology. We present an overview on camera trap uses for the study and conservation of wildlife, with a particular focus on tropical carnivores. Our goals are to promote proper and effective application of camera trapping and related analyses. We highlight major research avenues, give relevant examples and lessons learned from published material and from our own experiences, and review available resources for implementation, from preparation and camera trap field set up, to data management, analysis, and presentation of results. Our review considers sampling design with respect to target species or groups of species, the state variable(s) of interest, what constitutes a sample, sample size needed, collection of supporting data (independent variables), reducing bias/minimising error, and data collection schedule. We also highlight some available camera trap database management packages and available statistical packages to analyse camera trapping data. We discuss presenting findings to a wider audience so results become useful in the conservation and management of species. Finally, we discuss future development of camera trapping technology and related techniques for the study and conservation of carnivores in the tropics.},

	abstract = {Conservation programs often manage populations indirectly through the landscapes in which they live. Empirically, linking reproductive success with landscape structure and anthropogenic change is a first step in understanding and managing the spatial mechanisms that affect reproduction, but this link is not sufficiently informed by data. Hierarchical multistate occupancy models can forge these links by estimating spatial patterns of reproductive success across landscapes. To illustrate, we surveyed the occurrence of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains Alberta, Canada. We deployed camera traps for 6 weeks at 54 surveys sites in different types of land cover. We used hierarchical multistate occupancy models to estimate probability of detection, grizzly bear occupancy, and probability of reproductive success at each site. Grizzly bear occupancy varied among cover types and was greater in herbaceous alpine ecotones than in low-elevation wetlands or mid-elevation conifer forests. The conditional probability of reproductive success given grizzly bear occupancy was 30\% (SE = 0.14). Grizzly bears with cubs had a higher probability of detection than grizzly bears without cubs, but sites were correctly classified as being occupied by breeding females 49\% of the time based on raw data and thus would have been underestimated by half. Repeated surveys and multistate modeling reduced the probability of misclassifying sites occupied by breeders as unoccupied to {\textless}2\%. The probability of breeding grizzly bear occupancy varied across the landscape. Those patches with highest probabilities of breeding occupancy-herbaceous alpine ecotones-were small and highly dispersed and are projected to shrink as treelines advance due to climate warming. Understanding spatial correlates in breeding distribution is a key requirement for species conservation in the face of climate change and can help identify priorities for landscape management and protection.

Following a peak in January, the abundance of adult ticks declined such that they were rare or absent by June/July. The nymphal tick activity season occurred from January through October, and larval activity occurred from April to June, but sometimes extended into October. Thus, potentially infectious ticks (nymphs and adults) present a year-round risk of Lyme disease transmission in northwestern California. The seasonality of Lyme disease cases in humans, based on the onset of erythema migrans, mirrored tick activity patterns and was year-round in cases infected in California. Peak incidence in humans occurs from May through July, and indicates that most disease transmission is from nymphal ticks.

We evaluated high resolution satellite imagery as a tool to track the distribution and abundance of polar bears. We examined satellite images of a small island in Foxe Basin, Canada, occupied by a high density of bears during the summer ice-free season. Bears were distinguished from other light-colored spots by comparing images collected on different dates. A sample of ground-truthed points demonstrated that we accurately classified bears. Independent observers reviewed images and a population estimate was obtained using mark-recapture models. This estimate ([Formula: see text]: 94; 95\% Confidence Interval: 92-105) was remarkably similar to an abundance estimate derived from a line transect aerial survey conducted a few days earlier ([Formula: see text]: 102; 95\% CI: 69-152). Our findings suggest that satellite imagery is a promising tool for monitoring polar bears on land, with implications for use with other Arctic wildlife. Large scale applications may require development of automated detection processes to expedite review and analysis. Future research should assess the utility of multi-spectral imagery and examine sites with different environmental characteristics.},

	abstract = {1. Mark–recapture studies are often used to estimate adult survival probability , which is an important demographic parameter for long-lived species, as it can have a large impact on the population growth rate. We consider the impact of variation in capture probability among individuals (capture heterogeneity) on the estimation of ϕ from a mark–recapture study and thence on estimation of the asymptotic population growth rate .2. We review the mechanisms by which capture heterogeneity arises, methods of allowing for it in the analysis, and use simulation to assess the power of detecting three types of capture heterogeneity (two-group heterogeneity, trap-response and temporary emigration) using standard mark–recapture lack-of-fit tests.3. We use simulation to assess the bias that can arise in the estimation of ϕ from a mark–recapture study when we do not allow for capture heterogeneity. Using a generic population model, we assess the effect this bias has on estimation of .4. We use our results on the power of the lack-of-fit tests, together with a measure of the size of the bias relative to the standard error of the estimate of ϕ, to assess which situations might lead to an important level of undetected bias. Our results suggest that undetected bias is not likely to be an issue when there is trap-response, owing to the lack-of-fit tests having sufficient power to detect any trap-response that could lead to non-negligible bias. For two-group heterogeneity, the worst bias generally occurs when the difference between the capture probabilities for the two groups is moderate and both capture probabilities are low. For temporary emigration, the worst bias generally occurs when the rate of emigration and the capture probability are both low.5. We illustrate the issues for conservation management using data from studies of Hector’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) in New Zealand and wolves (Canis lupus) in France.6. Previous studies have suggested that capture heterogeneity will generally lead to a relatively small bias in the estimate of ϕ. However, given the high sensitivity of the asymptotic population growth rate to adult survival, a small bias in ϕ might lead to nontrivial bias in the estimate of .},

Planning for conservation success requires identifying effective and efficient monitoring strategies but multiple types of uncertainty affect the accuracy and precision of wildlife abundance estimates. Observation uncertainty, a consequence of sampling effort and design as well as the process of observation, is still understudied, with little attention given to the multiple potential sources of error involved. To establish error minimization priorities and maximize monitoring efficiency, the direction and magnitude of multiple sources of uncertainty must be considered. 2. Using monitoring of two contrasting ungulate species in the Serengeti ecosystem as a case study, we developed a 'virtual ecologist' framework within which we carried out simulated tests of different monitoring strategies for different types of species. We investigated which components of monitoring should be prioritized to increase survey accuracy and precision and explored the robustness of population estimates under different budgetary scenarios. 3. The relative importance of each process affecting precision and accuracy varied according to the survey technique and biological characteristics of the species. While survey precision was mainly affected by population characteristics and sampling effort, the accuracy of the survey was greatly affected by observer effects, such as juvenile and herd detectability. 4. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring efficiency is of the utmost importance for conservation, especially in the context of limited budgets and other priorities. We provide insights into the likely effect of different types of observation and process error on population estimates for savanna ungulates, and more generally present a framework for evaluating monitoring programmes in a virtual environment. In highly aggregated species, the main focus should be on survey precision; sampling effort should be defined according to wildlife spatial distribution. For random or slightly aggregated species, accuracy is the key factor; this is most sensitive to observer effects which should be minimized by training and calibration by observer.},

	abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

When only a portion of the population is uniquely identifiable, traditional and spatial mark–resight models provide a viable alternative. We reanalyzed a data set that used photographic capture–recapture methods to estimate the densities of pumas (Puma concolor) across 3 study sites in Belize, Argentina, and Bolivia using newer, more-advanced modeling including spatial and nonspatial mark–resight techniques. Additionally, we assessed how photo identification influenced density estimates by comparing estimates based on capture histories constructed by 3 independent investigators. We estimated the abundances of pumas using mark–resight models in program MARK and then estimated densities ad hoc. We also estimated densities directly using spatial mark–resight models implemented in a Bayesian framework. Puma densities did not vary substantially among observers but estimates generated from the 3 statistical techniques did differ. Density estimates (pumas/100 km2) from spatial mark–resight models were lower (0.22–7.92) and had increased precision compared to those from nonspatial capture–recapture (0.50–19.35) and mark–resight techniques (0.54–14.70). Our study is the 1st to estimate the density of a population of carnivores, where only a subset of the individuals are naturally marked, using camera-trapping surveys in combination with spatial mark–resight models. The development of spatial mark–resight and spatially explicit capture–recapture techniques creates the potential for using a single camera-trapping array to estimate the density of multiple, sympatric carnivores, including both partially marked and uniquely marked species.},

	abstract = {1.Many capture-recapture surveys of wildlife populations operate in continuous time but detections are typically aggregated into occasions for analysis, even when exact detection times are available. This discards information and introduces subjectivity, in the form of decisions about occasion definition. 2.We develop a spatio-temporal Poisson process model for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) surveys that operate continuously and record exact detection times. We show that, except in some special cases (including the case in which detection probability does not change within occasion), temporally aggregated data do not provide sufficient statistics for density and related parameters, and that when detection probability is constant over time our continuous-time (CT) model is equivalent to an existing model based on detection frequencies. We use the model to estimate jaguar density from a camera-trap survey and conduct a simulation study to investigate the properties of a CT estimator and discrete-occasion estimators with various levels of temporal aggregation. This includes investigation of the effect on the estimators of spatio-temporal correlation induced by animal movement. 3.The CT estimator is found to be unbiased and more precise than discrete-occasion estimators based on binary capture data (rather than detection frequencies) when there is no spatio-temporal correlation. It is also found to be only slightly biased when there is correlation induced by animal movement, and to be more robust to inadequate detector spacing, while discrete-occasion estimators with binary data can be sensitive to occasion length, particularly in the presence of inadequate detector spacing. 4.Our model includes as a special case a discrete-occasion estimator based on detection frequencies, and at the same time lays a foundation for the development of more sophisticated CT models and estimators. It allows modelling within-occasion changes in detectability, readily accommodates variation in detector effort, removes subjectivity associated with user-defined occasions, and fully utilises CT data. We identify a need for developing CT methods that in corporate spatio-temporal dependence in detections and see potential for CT models being combined with telemetry-based animal movement models to provide a richer inference framework.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Lead (Pb) is a metabolic poison that can negatively influence biological processes, leading to illness and mortality across a large spectrum of North American avifauna ({\textgreater}120 species) and other organisms. Pb poisoning can result from numerous sources, including ingestion of bullet fragments and shot pellets left in animal carcasses, spent ammunition left in the field, lost fishing tackle, Pb-based paints, large-scale mining, and Pb smelting activities. Although Pb shot has been banned for waterfowl hunting in the United States (since 1991) and Canada (since 1999), Pb exposure remains a problem for many avian species. Despite a large body of scientific literature on exposure to Pb and its toxicological effects on birds, controversy still exists regarding its impacts at a population level. We explore these issues and highlight areas in need of investigation: (1) variation in sensitivity to Pb exposure among bird species; (2) spatial extent and sources of Pb contamination in habitats in relation to bird exposure in those same locations; and (3) interactions between avian Pb exposure and other landscape-level stressors that synergistically affect bird demography. We explore multiple paths taken to reduce Pb exposure in birds that (1) recognize common ground among a range of affected interests; (2) have been applied at local to national scales; and (3) engage governmental agencies, interest groups, and professional societies to communicate the impacts of Pb ammunition and fishing tackle, and to describe approaches for reducing their availability to birds. As they have in previous times, users of fish and wildlife will play a key role in resolving the Pb poisoning issue. ,  RESUMEN El plomo (Pb) es un veneno metabólico que puede influenciar negativamente los procesos biológicos produciendo enfermedades y la muerte de un gran espectro de aves de América del Norte ({\textgreater}120 especies) y de otros organismos. El envenenamiento por Pb puede provenir de múltiples fuentes, incluyendo la ingestión de fragmentos de balas y perdigones que quedan en los cadáveres de los animales, municiones usadas y dejadas en el campo, aparejos de pesca abandonados, pinturas a base de Pb, minería a gran escala y actividades de fundición de Pb. Los disparos que contienen Pb han sido prohibidos para la caza de aves acuáticas en Estados Unidos (desde 1991) y Canadá (desde 1999). Sin embrago, la exposición no intencional de muchas aves al Pb continua. A pesar de que existe una enorme cantidad de literatura científica sobre la exposición y los efectos toxicológicos del Pb en las aves, existe aún controversia sobre los impactos a nivel poblacional. Evaluamos estos aspectos y subrayamos las áreas que necesitan investigación: (1) variación en la sensibilidad a la exposición al Pb entre las especies de aves; (2) extensión espacial y fuentes de contaminación de Pb en los hábitats en relación con la exposición de las aves en esas mismas localidades; e (3) interacciones entre la exposición de las aves al Pb y otras fuentes de estrés a escala de paisaje que afectan de modo sinérgico la demografía de las aves. Exploramos múltiples iniciativas que apuntan a la reducción de la exposición de las aves al Pb que: (1) reconocen aspectos comunes en un rango de intereses afectados; (2) han sido aplicadas a la escala local y nacional; e (3) involucran agencias de gobierno, grupos de interés y sociedades de profesionales para comunicar los impactos de las municiones de Pb y de los aparejos de pesca y para describir los enfoques para reducir su disponibilidad para las aves. Como ha ocurrido en otras ocasiones, los usuarios consuntivos de los peces y de la vida silvestre jugarán un rol muy importante para resolver el tema del envenenamiento por Pb.

We report, for the first time, the population trends and vital rates of the endangered snow leopard based on camera trapping over four years in the Tost Mountains, South Gobi, Mongolia. We used robust design multi-season mark-recapture analysis to estimate the trends in abundance, sex ratio, survival probability and the probability of temporary emigration and immigration for adult and young snow leopards. The snow leopard population remained constant over most of the study period, with no apparent growth (λ = 1.08+−0.25). Comparison of model results with the “known population” of radio-collared snow leopards suggested high accuracy in our estimates. Although seemingly stable, vigorous underlying dynamics were evident in this population, with the adult sex ratio shifting from being male-biased to female-biased (1.67 to 0.38 males per female) during the study. Adult survival probability was 0.82 (SE+−0.08) and that of young was 0.83 (SE+−0.15) and 0.77 (SE +−0.2) respectively, before and after the age of 2 years. Young snow leopards showed a high probability of temporary emigration and immigration (0.6, SE +−0.19 and 0.68, SE +−0.32 before and after the age of 2 years) though not the adults (0.02 SE+−0.07). While the current female-bias in the population and the number of cubs born each year seemingly render the study population safe, the vigorous dynamics suggests that the situation can change quickly. The reduction in the proportion of male snow leopards may be indicative of continuing anthropogenic pressures. Our work reiterates the importance of monitoring both the abundance and population dynamics of species for effective conservation.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges in estimating grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) population size using DNA methods is heterogeneity of capture probabilities. This study developed general tools to explore heterogeneity variation using data from a DNA mark-recapture project in which a proportion of the bear population had GPS collars. The Huggins closed population mark-recapture model was used to determine if capture probability was influenced by sex or collar status. In addition, trap encounter rates were estimated by comparing the closest distance from traps where hair was snagged of bears that were captured, with bears for which we had radiolocations but were not captured. Results of the Huggins analysis suggested that sex, distance of bear DNA capture from grid edge, and whether a bear was radiocollared potentially affected capture probabilities. The encounter rate analysis estimated that 63\% of bears that encountered traps were snagged, and that males encountered more traps than females. The following conclusions arise from this study. First, the distance of DNA capture of bears relative to the grid edge should be modeled as an individual covariate to ensure robust estimates of superpopulation size when closure violation is suspected. Second, sampling should be intensive to minimize heterogeneity and to ensure all bears encounter traps. Finally, estimators that are robust to heterogeneity variation should be used, given the various sources of heterogeneity variation.},

	abstract = {Density estimates are critical to proper population management and conservation, yet difficult to obtain for many wide-ranging or cryptic species. One proven method used to quantify carnivore density, especially species difficult to individually identify from photos taken by camera traps, utilizes overlapping home ranges of individual animals in the study area. This method, however, may be particularly prone to residency and extrapolation biases. Residency bias occurs when the reference area for the density estimate is incorrect, and extrapolation bias occurs when scaling a density to a different spatial extent than that of the study area upon which the estimate was based. We used a simulation approach based on GPS locations to diagnose potential biases in published densities of pumas Puma concolor from Patagonia, where Franklin et al. 1999 (Biol. Conserv. 90: 33–40) reported ‘minimum’ densities of 6 and 30 pumas per 100 km2, and Elbroch and Wittmer 2012a (Mammal. Biol. 77: 377–384) reported densities of 3.4 pumas per 100 km2. Using GPS data from the latter study we tested methods described in Franklin et al. (1999) and compared their outcomes. Our results showed that density estimates that do not account for residency bias resulted in severely inflated density estimates. Our findings also indicated that actual densities from Franklin et al. (1999) might have been an order of magnitude lower than reported, and therefore consistent with puma densities reported across the range of the species. Both studies introduced extrapolation bias by translating linearly their estimates to new spatial extents, although the magnitude of this bias was much less than that of residency bias. Our results underscore the need for rigorous accounting of residential space in estimating population density, and highlight the scale-dependency of density estimates},

	abstract = {1 The ability to identify individual animals is a critical aid in wildlife and conservation studies requiring information on behaviour, distribution, habitat use, population and life-history parameters. We present a computer-aided photo-identification technique that relies on natural marks to identify individuals of Carcharias taurus, a shark species that is critically endangered off the eastern Australian coast and considered globally vulnerable. The technique could potentially be applied to a range of species of similar form and bearing natural marks. 2 The use of natural marks for photo-identification is a non-invasive technique for identifying individual animals. As photo-identification databases grow larger, and their implementation spans several years, the historically used visual-matching processes lose accuracy and speed. A computerized pattern-matching system that requires initial user interaction to select the key features aids researchers by considerably reducing the time needed for identification of individuals. 3 Our method uses a two-dimensional affine transformation to compare two individuals in a commonly defined reference space. The methodology was developed using a database of 221 individually identifiable sharks that were photographically marked and rephotographed over 9 years, demonstrating both the efficacy of the technique and that the natural pigment marks of C. taurus are a reliable means of tracking individuals over several years. 4 Synthesis and applications. The identification of individual animals that are naturally marked with spots or similar patterns is achieved with an interactive pattern-matching system that uses an affine transformation to compare selected points in a single-user computer-aided interface. Our technique has been used successfully on C. taurus and we believe the methodology can be applied to other species of a similar form that have natural marks or patterns. The identification of individuals allows accurate tracking of their movements and distribution, and contributes to better population estimates for improved wildlife management and conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of population sizes in delimited spatial regions is crucial for most ecological research. Data from population surveys are collected with strip, line, or point transects sampling. These data are positively skewed and spatially autocorrelated, which makes estimation of uncertainty in the population size difficult. Thus, we propose a novel spatial-based estimator from a hierarchical spatial model for count data where the inhomogeneous animal density is decomposed into a deterministic trend related to potential habitat and a stationary latent field modeled by geostatistics. An empirical estimate of the latent variable is obtained including corrective terms for non-stationarity and variance resulting from a Poisson distribution of sightings. A novel block kriging estimator that takes into account both non-stationarity and the nature of count data is derived to obtain a spatial estimate of animal total abundance and variance of errors of prediction. From spatial simulated count data and real count data of common guillemot wintering in the Bay of Biscay (France), we compare mean population size and variance estimates obtained from our model-based approach to the design-based estimator (i.e., block bootstrap). The novel Poisson block kriging estimates greatly reduces uncertainty of population size estimates while block bootstrap provides larger uncertainties. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recently developed capture-mark-recapture methods allow us to account for capture heterogeneity among individuals in the form of discrete mixtures and continuous individual random effects. In this article, we used simulations and two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of continuously distributed individual random effects at removing potential bias due to capture heterogeneity, and to evaluate in what situation the added complexity of these models is justified. Simulations and case studies showed that ignoring individual capture heterogeneity generally led to a small negative bias in survival estimates and that individual random effects effectively removed this bias. As expected, accounting for capture heterogeneity also led to slightly less precise survival estimates. Our case studies also showed that accounting for capture heterogeneity increased in importance towards the end of study. Though ignoring capture heterogeneity led to a small bias in survival estimates, such bias may greatly impact management decisions. We advocate reducing potential heterogeneity at the sampling design stage. Where this is insufficient, we recommend modelling individual capture heterogeneity in situations such as when a large proportion of the individuals has a low detection probability (e.g. in the presence of floaters) and situations where the most recent survival estimates are of great interest (e.g. in applied conservation).},

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

	abstract = {Estimating density of elusive carnivores with capture-recapture analyses is increasingly common. However, providing unbiased and precise estimates is still a challenge due to uncertainties arising from the use of (1) bait or lure to attract animals to the detection device and (2) ad hoc boundary-strip methods to compensate for edge effects in area estimation. We used photographic-sampling data of the Malagasy civet Fossa fossana collected with and without lure to assess the effects of lure and to compare the use of four density estimators which varied in methods of area estimation. The use of lure did not affect permanent immigration or emigration, abundance and density estimation, maximum movement distances, or temporal activity patterns of Malagasy civets, but did provide more precise population estimates by increasing the number of recaptures. The spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model density estimates +/- SE were the least precise as they incorporate spatial variation, but consistent with each other (Maximum likelihood-SECR = 1.38 +/- A 0.18, Bayesian-SECR = 1.24 +/- A 0.17 civets/km(2)), whereas estimates relying on boundary-strip methods to estimate effective trapping area did not incorporate spatial variation, varied greatly and were generally larger than SECR model estimates. Estimating carnivore density with ad hoc boundary-strip methods can lead to overestimation and/or increased uncertainty as they do not incorporate spatial variation. This may lead to inaction or poor management decisions which may jeopardize at-risk populations. In contrast, SECR models free researchers from making subjective decisions associated with boundary-strip methods and they estimate density directly, providing more comparable and valuable population estimates.},

	abstract = {Presence-only records may provide data on the distributions of rare species, but commonly suffer from large, unknown biases due to their typically haphazard collection schemes. Presence-absence or count data collected in systematic, planned surveys are more reliable but typically less abundant. We proposed a probabilistic model to allow for joint analysis of presence-only and survey data to exploit their complementary strengths. Our method pools presence-only and presence-absence data for many species and maximizes a joint likelihood, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for the sampling bias affecting the presence-only data. By assuming that the sampling bias is the same for all species, we can borrow strength across species to efficiently estimate the bias and improve our inference from presence-only data. We evaluate our model's performance on data for 36 eucalypt species in southeastern Australia. We find that presence-only records exhibit a strong sampling bias toward the coast and toward Sydney, the largest city. Our data-pooling technique substantially improves the out-of-sample predictive performance of our model when the amount of available presence-absence data for a given species is scarce. If we have only presence-only data and no presence-absence data for a given species, but both types of data for several other species that suffer from the same spatial sampling bias, then our method can obtain an unbiased estimate of the first species' geographic range.},

	abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

Although many reintroduction schemes for the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in Germany have been discussed, the implications of connectivity between suitable patches have not been assessed. 2. We introduce an individual-based, spatially explicit dispersal model to assess the probability of a dispersing animal reaching another suitable patch in the complex heterogeneous German landscape, with its dense transport system. The dispersal model was calibrated using telemetric data from the Swiss Jura and based on a map of potential lynx dispersal habitat. 3. Most suitable patches could be interconnected by movements of dispersing lynx within 10 years of reintroduction. However, when realistic levels of mortality risks on roads were applied, most patches become isolated except along the German-Czech border. Consequently, patch connectivity is limited not so much by the distribution of dispersal habitat but by the high mortality of dispersing lynx. Accordingly, rather than solely investing in habitat restoration, management efforts should try to reduce road mortality. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our approach illustrates how spatially explicit dispersal models can guide conservation efforts and reintroduction programmes even where data are scarce. Clear limits imposed by substantial road mortality will affect dispersing lynx as well as other large carnivores, unless offset by careful road-crossing management or by the careful selection of release points in reintroduction programmes.},

	abstract = {Conservation scientists are increasingly focusing on the drivers of human behavior and on the implications of various sources of uncertainty for management decision making. Trophy hunting has been suggested as a conservation tool because it gives economic value to wildlife, but recent examples show that overharvesting is a substantial problem and that data limitations are rife. We use a case study of trophy hunting of an endangered antelope, the mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), to explore how uncertainties generated by population monitoring and poaching interact with decision making by 2 key stakeholders: the safari companies and the government. We built a management strategy evaluation model that encompasses the population dynamics of mountain nyala, a monitoring model, and a company decision making model. We investigated scenarios of investment into antipoaching and monitoring by governments and safari companies. Harvest strategy was robust to the uncertainty in the population estimates obtained from monitoring, but poaching had a much stronger effect on quota and sustainability. Hence, reducing poaching is in the interests of companies wishing to increase the profitability of their enterprises, for example by engaging community members as game scouts. There is a threshold level of uncertainty in the population estimates beyond which the year-to-year variation in the trophy quota prevented planning by the safari companies. This suggests a role for government in ensuring that a baseline level of population monitoring is carried out such that this level is not exceeded. Our results illustrate the importance of considering the incentives of multiple stakeholders when designing frameworks for resource use and when designing management frameworks to address the particular sources of uncertainty that affect system sustainability most heavily. Incentivando el Monitoreo y el Cumplimiento en la Caza de Trofeos Científicos conservacionistas cada vez se enfocan más en los conductores del comportamiento humano y en las implicaciones de varias fuentes de incertidumbre en la toma de decisiones de manejo. La cacería de trofeos ha sido sugerida como una herramienta de conservación porque le otorga valor económico a la vida silvestre, pero ejemplos recientes muestran que la sobrecolecta es un problema sustancial y que las limitaciones de datos son abundantes. Usamos el estudio de caso de la cacería de trofeos de un antílope en peligro, el nyala de las montañas (Tragelaphus buxtoni), para explorar como las incertidumbres generadas por el monitoreo de poblaciones y el tráfico de especies interactúan con la toma de decisiones de 2 actores clave: las compañías de safari y el gobierno. Construimos un modelo de evaluación de estrategia de manejo que incluye la dinámica poblacional del nyala de las montañas, un modelo de monitoreo y un modelo de toma de decisiones de una compañía. Investigamos escenarios de inversión en el combate del tráfico de especies y el monitoreo por el gobierno y las compañías de safari. La estrategia de colecta fue robusta hacia la incertidumbre en los estimados de población obtenidos del monitoreo, pero el tráfico de especies tuvo un efecto más fuerte sobre la cuota y la sustentabilidad; por esto, reducir el tráfico de especies está dentro de los intereses de compañías que desean incrementar la rentabilidad de las empresas, por ejemplo al hacer participar a los miembros de la comunidad como guías de caza. Hay un nivel umbral de incertidumbre en los estimados de población más allá del cual la variación anual en la cuota de trofeos previene la planeación por parte de las compañías de safari. Esto sugiere un papel para el gobierno asegurando que un nivel base de monitoreo de población se lleve a cabo para que este nivel no sea excedido. Nuestros resultados ilustran la importancia de considerar los incentivos de partes interesadas múltiples al designar marcos de trabajo para el uso de recursos y que al designar marcos de trabajo de manejo dirigirse a las fuentes particulares de incertidumbre que afecten más al sistema de sustentabilidad.},

However, under such a framework, reliable estimates can be difficult to obtain because animals move on and off of the site during the sampling session (i.e., the site is not closed geographically). Generally, practitioners address lack of geographic closure by inflating the area sampled by the detectors based on the mean distance individuals moved between trapping events or invoking hierarchical models in which animal density is assumed to be a spatial point process, and detection is modeled as a declining function of distance to a detector. We provide an alternative in which lack of geographic closure is sampled directly using telemetry, and this auxiliary information is used to compute estimates of density based on a modified Huggins closed-capture estimator. Contrary to other approaches, this method is free from assumptions regarding the distribution and movement of animals on the landscape, the stationarity of their home ranges, and biases induced by abnormal movements in response to baited detectors. The estimator is freely available in Program MARK.},

	abstract = {1. Understanding species spatial occurrence patterns and their environmental dependence is one of the fundamental goals in ecology and evolution. Often, occurrence models are built with presence-only data because absence data are unavailable. We compare the strengths and limitations of the recently developed presence-only modelling method, Maxlike, with the more widely used Maxent. 2. In spite of disparities highlighted by the developers of Maxlike and Maxent, we show approximate formal relationships between the parameters of Maxlike and Maxent for two scenarios to illustrate their similarity. Using case studies based on real and simulated data, we show how these similarities manifest in practice. 3. We found more similarities than differences between Maxlike and Maxent, including coefficient values, predicted spatial distributions, similarity to presence–absence models, predictive performance and ranking the pre- dicted suitability of cells. Maxlike reliably predicted absolute occurrence probabilities for very large data sets on landscapes where occurrence probability approximately spanned [0,1]. For smaller data sets, the uncertainty in predicted occurrence probability by Maxlike was very large, due to the inherent limitations of presence-only data. In contrast, Maxent is constrained to predicting relative occurrence probabilities or relative occurrence rates unless it is provided with additional information from presence–absence data. Both models can reliably pre- dict relative differences in occurrence probability. 4. The choice of which model to use depends partly on sampling assumptions, which we discuss in detail. Due to limitations of presence-only data, ecologists should typically focus on interpretations relying on relative differences in occurrence probability or relative occurrence rates. We discuss how to remedy a number of concerns about the use of Maxent and how to avoid some potential pitfalls with Maxlike – particularly related to high variance predictions. We conclude that both methods are similarly valuable for understanding and predicting species’ distributions in terms of relative differences in occurrence probability when the models are specified carefully.},

	abstract = {Various monitoring methods have been developed for large carnivores, but not all are practical or sufficiently accurate for long-term monitoring over large spatial scales. From 2009 to 2010, we used a predictive habitat model to locate gray wolf rendezvous sites in 4 study areas in Idaho, USA and conducted noninvasive genetic sampling (NGS) of scat and hair found at the sites. We evaluated species and individual identification PCR success rates across the study areas, and estimated population size with a single-session population estimator using 2 different recapture-coding methods. We then compared NGS population estimates to estimates generated concurrently from telemetry data. We collected 1,937 scat and 166 hair samples and identified 193 unique individuals over 2 years. For fecal DNA samples, species identification success rates were consistently high ({\textgreater}92\%) across areas. Individual identification success rates ranged from 78\% to 80\% in the drier study areas and dropped to 50\% in the wettest study area. The degree of agreement between NGS- and telemetry-derived population estimates varied by recapture-coding method with considerable variability in 95\% confidence intervals. Population estimates derived from NGS methods were most influenced by the average number of detections per individual. We demonstrate how changes in field effort and recapture-coding method can affect population estimates in a widely used single-session population estimation model. Our study highlights the need to further develop reliable population estimation tools for single-session NGS data, especially those with large differences in capture frequencies among individuals stemming from severe capture heterogeneity (i.e., overdispersion). © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.},

	abstract = {Traditional predation theory assumes that prey density is the primary determinant of kill rate. More recently, the ratio of prey-to-predator has been shown to be a better predictor of kill rate. However, the selective behavior of many predators also suggests that age structure of the prey population should be an important predictor of kill rate. We compared wolf-moose predation dynamics in two sites, south-central Scandinavia (SCA) and Isle Royale, Lake Superior, North America (IR), where prey density was similar, but where prey age structure and prey-to-predator ratio differed. Per capita kill rates of wolves preying on moose in SCA are three times greater than on IR. Because SCA and IR have similar prey densities differences in kill rate cannot be explained by prey density. Instead, differences in kill rate are explained by differences in the ratio of prey-to-predator, pack size and age structure of the prey populations. Although ratio-dependent functional responses was an important variable for explaining differences in kill rates between SCA and IR, kill rates tended to be higher when calves comprised a greater portion of wolves' diet (p =0.05). Our study is the first to suggest how age structure of the prey population can affect kill rate for a mammalian predator. Differences in age structure of the SCA and IR prey populations are, in large part, the result of moose and forests being exploited in SCA, but not in IR. While predator conservation is largely motivated by restoring trophic cascades and other top-down influences, our results show how human enterprises can also alter predation through bottom-up processes.

	abstract = {Wildlife populations consist of individuals that contribute disproportionately to growth and viability. Understanding a population's spatial and temporal dynamics requires estimates of abundance and demographic rates that account for this heterogeneity. Estimating these quantities can be difficult, requiring years of intensive data collection. Often, this is accomplished through the capture and recapture of individual animals, which is generally only feasible at a limited number of locations. In contrast, N-mixture models allow for the estimation of abundance, and spatial variation in abundance, from count data alone. We extend recently developed multistate, open population N-mixture models, which can additionally estimate demographic rates based on an organism's life history characteristics. In our extension, we develop an approach to account for the case where not all individuals can be assigned to a state during sampling. Using only state-specific count data, we show how our model can be used to estimate local population abundance, as well as density-dependent recruitment rates and state-specific survival. We apply our model to a population of black-throated blue warblers (Setophaga caerulescens) that have been surveyed for 25 years on their breeding grounds at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. The intensive data collection efforts allow us to compare our estimates to estimates derived from capture-recapture data. Our model performed well in estimating population abundance and density-dependent rates of annual recruitment/immigration. Estimates of local carrying capacity and per capita recruitment of yearlings were consistent with those published in other studies. However, our model moderately underestimated annual survival probability of yearling and adult females and severely underestimates survival probabilities for both of these male stages. The most accurate and precise estimates will necessarily require some amount of intensive data collection efforts (such as capture-recapture). Integrated population models that combine data from both intensive and extensive sources are likely to be the most efficient approach for estimating demographic rates at large spatial and temporal scales.},

Distance from the observer is a ubiquitous source of heterogeneity, because nearby birds are more easily detected than distant ones.

	abstract = {Seasonal patterns of climate and vegetation growth are expected to be altered by global warming. In alpine environments, the reproduction of birds and mammals is tightly linked to seasonality; therefore such alterations may have strong repercussions on recruitment. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a satellite-based measurement that correlates strongly with aboveground net primary productivity, to explore how annual variations in the timing of vegetation onset and in the rate of change in primary production during green-up affected juvenile growth and survival of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in four different populations in two continents. We indexed timing of onset of vegetation growth by the integrated NDVI (INDVI) in May. The rate of change in primary production during green-up (early May to early July) was estimated as (1) the maximal slope between any two successive bimonthly NDVI values during this period and (2) the slope in NDVI between early May and early July. The maximal slope in NDVI was negatively correlated with lamb growth and survival in both populations of bighorn sheep, growth of mountain goat kids, and survival of Alpine ibex kids, but not with survival of mountain goat kids. There was no effect of INDVI in May and of the slope in NDVI between early May and early July on juvenile growth and survival for any species. Although rapid changes in NDVI during the green-up period could translate into higher plant productivity, they may also lead to a shorter period of availability of high-quality forage over a large spatial scale, decreasing the opportunity for mountain ungulates to exploit high-quality forage. Our results suggest that attempts to forecast how warmer winters and springs will affect animal population dynamics and life histories in alpine environments should consider factors influencing the rate of changes in primary production during green-up and the timing of vegetation onset.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Annelida is one of the major protostome phyla, whose deep phylogeny is very poorly understood. Recent molecular phylogenies show that Annelida may include groups once considered separate phyla (Pogonophora, Echiurida, and Sipunculida) and that Clitellata are derived polychaetes. The "total-evidence" analyses combining morphological and molecular characters have been published for a few annelid taxa. No attempt has yet been made to analyse simultaneously morphological and molecular information concerning the Annelida as a whole. RESULTS: Phylogenetic relationships within Annelida were analysed on the basis of 93 morphological characters and sequences of six genes (18S, 28S, and 16S rRNA, EF1alpha, H3, COI), altogether, 87 terminals of all annelid "families" and 3,903 informative characters, by Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods. The analysis of the combined dataset yields the following scheme of relationships: Phyllodocida and Eunicida are monophyletic groups, together probably forming monophyletic Aciculata (incl. Orbiniidae and Parergodrilidae that form a sister group of the Eunicida). The traditional "Scolecida" and "Canalipalpata" are both polyphyletic, forming instead two clades: one including Cirratuliformia and the "sabelloid-spionoid clade" (incl. Sternaspis, Sabellidae-Serpulidae, Sabellariidae, Spionida s.str.), the other ("terebelloid-capitelloid clade") including Terebelliformia, Arenicolidae-Maldanidae, and Capitellidae-Echiurida. The Clitellata and "clitellate-like polychaetes" (Aeolosomatidae, Potamodrilidae, Hrabeiella) form a monophyletic group. The position of the remaining annelid groups is uncertain - the most problematic taxa are the Opheliidae-Scalibregmatidae clade, the Amphinomida-Aberranta clade, Apistobranchus, Chaetopteridae, Myzostomida, the Sipunculida-Dinophilidae clade, and the "core Archiannelida" (= Protodrilidae, Nerillidae, Polygordiidae, Saccocirridae). CONCLUSIONS: The combined ("total-evidence") phylogenetic analysis provides a modified view of annelid evolution, with several higher-level taxa, i.e. Phyllodocida, Eunicida, orbinioid-parergodrilid clade (OPC), Cirratuliformia, sabelloid-spionoid clade (SSC), terebelloid-capitelloid clade (TCC), and "Clitellatomorpha". Two unorthodox clades, the "core Archiannelida" and Sipunculida-Dinophilidae, are proposed. Although the deep-level evolutionary relationships of Annelida remain poorly understood, we propose the monophyly of the Aciculata, sister-group relationships between the Eunicida and OPC, between the Cirratuliformia and SSC, and possibly also between the "Clitellatomorpha" and Oweniidae-Pogonophora clades.},

Spatial capture-recapture models provide an advantage over non-spatial models by explicitly accounting for heterogeneous detection probabilities among individuals that arise due to the spatial organization of individuals relative to sampling devices. We simulated black bear (Ursus americanus) populations and spatial capture-recapture data to evaluate the influence of trap configuration and trap spacing on estimates of population size and a spatial scale parameter, sigma, that relates to home range size. We varied detection probability and home range size, and considered three trap configurations common to large-mammal mark-recapture studies: regular spacing, clustered, and a temporal sequence of different cluster configurations (i.e., trap relocation). We explored trap spacing and number of traps per cluster by varying the number of traps. The clustered arrangement performed well when detection rates were low, and provides for easier field implementation than the sequential trap arrangement. However, performance differences between trap configurations diminished as home range size increased. Our simulations suggest it is important to consider trap spacing relative to home range sizes, with traps ideally spaced no more than twice the spatial scale parameter. While spatial capture-recapture models can accommodate different sampling designs and still estimate parameters with accuracy and precision, our simulations demonstrate that aspects of sampling design, namely trap configuration and spacing, must consider study area size, ranges of individual movement, and home range sizes in the study population.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of catchability (HC) among the individuals encountered during a capture-recapture study has long been regarded as a liability. However, heterogeneous capture probabilities may reflect interesting but hidden features of the population, such as social status. The difficulty is to distinguish between this intrinsic heterogeneity and the extrinsic heterogeneity induced by the study itself. So far, population ecologists have not been able to distinguish between these two sources of variation in capture heterogeneity because, in the presence of heterogeneity of capture in the data, they have frequently used a too simple approach. This traditional approach, which consists of incorporating two common sources of lack of fit (transience and trap-dependence), does not directly model the HC and thus cannot investigate its biological meaning. In this context, we propose, for open populations, to directly model the HC by employing multievent models. Multievent models make it possible to break HC into two classes of catchability viewed as uncertain states. With the introduction of a coefficient of heterogeneity to model proportional probabilities of capture over time in the two classes, our approach allows the investigation of HC in a parsimonious way. In this paper, we apply both this new approach and the traditional approach to a long-term data set of male deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus. We then compare 13 candidate models separately for each approach. Our results indicate that the new approach is superior to the traditional approach.},

	abstract = {Aim During the past decade ecologists have attempted to estimate the parameters of species distributionmodels by combining locations of species presence observed in opportunistic surveys with spatially referenced covariates of occurrence. Several statistical models have been proposed for the analysis of presence-only data, but these models have largely ignored the effects of imperfect detection and survey bias. In this paper I describe a model-based approach for the analysis of presence-only data that accounts for errors in the detection of individuals and for biased selection of survey locations. Innovation I develop a hierarchical, statistical model that allows presence-only data to be analysed in conjunction with data acquired independently in planned surveys. One component of the model specifies the spatial distribution of individ- uals within a bounded, geographic region as a realization of a spatial point process. A second component of the model specifies two kinds of observations, the detec- tion of individuals encountered during opportunistic surveys and the detection of individuals encountered during planned surveys. Main conclusions Using mathematical proof and simulation-based compari- sons, I demonstrate that biases induced by errors in detection or biased selection of survey locations can be reduced or eliminated by using the hierarchical model to analyse presence-only data in conjunction with counts observed in planned surveys. I show that a relatively small number of high-quality data (from planned surveys) can be used to leverage the information in presence-only observations, which usually have broad spatial coverage but may not be informative of both occurrence and detectability of individuals. Because a variety of sampling protocols can be used in planned surveys, this approach to the analysis of presence-only data is widely applicable. In addition, since the point-process model is formulated at the level of an individual, it can be extended to account for biological interactions between individuals and temporal changes in their spatial distributions.

Recently developed spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models provide a framework for estimating density of animal populations but thus far have not been used to study connectivity. Rather, all applications of SCR models have used encounter probability models based on the Euclidean distance between traps and animal activity centers, which implies that home ranges are stationary, symmetric, and unaffected by landscape structure. In this paper we devise encounter probability models based on “ecological distance,” i.e., the least-cost path between traps and activity centers, which is a function of both Euclidean distance and animal movement behavior in resistant landscapes. We integrate least-cost path models into a likelihood-based estimation scheme for spatial capture–recapture models in order to estimate population density and paramete...},

	abstract = {We evaluated the change of roe deer habitat in response to three forest management scenarios: no harvest, clear-cut and single tree selection. For this purpose we simulated forest and understory vegetation in response to management for a 50-year period in an alpine forest region using the individual tree growth model PROGNAUS with an extension for understory vegetation. We also represented the spatial distribution of forest stands in a geographic information system. Habitat suitability and the forest's predisposition to browsing were then evaluated using models developed by Reimoser and Zandl [Reimoser, F., Zandl, J., 1993.

FIW Forschungsberichte 1993/4, ??sterreichische Gesellschaft f??r Wald??kosystemforschung und experimentelle Baumforschung, 104 pp.]. These models aggregate eight habitat variables (canopy cover, canopy cover of evergreen trees, stand structural class, eight types of understory vegetation, density of forest margins, aspect, elevation and meso-relief) to four life requisites for roe deer: forage, cover from predators, shelter from adverse weather and daytime loafing area. These variables are then weighted and combined to form an overall habitat suitability and browsing predisposition score. Results of the simulation showed that for roe deer: quantity and quality of food supply were similar for all three scenarios. No harvest produced the best thermal cover. "Clear-cut management" resulted in the best hiding cover and high values for the living area index. For single tree selection thermal cover for roe deer was lowest. Clear-cutting was best for overall habitat quality. The ratio between forage and food independent settling stimulus was however disadvantageous in this management system. Clear-cut management therefore is attractive for roe deer, but facilitates over abundant roe deer populations which consequently cause damage to forests. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abundance and density of wild animals are important ecological metrics. However, estimating either is fraught with challenges; spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models are a relatively new class of models that attempt to ameliorate common challenges, providing a statistically coherent framework to estimate abundance and density. SCR models are increasingly being used in ecological and conservation studies of mammals worldwide, but have received little testing with empirical field data. We use data collected via a web and grid sampling design to evaluate the basic SCR model where small-mammal abundance (N) and density (D) are known (via exhaustive sampling). We fit the basic SCR model with and without a behavioral effect to 11 small-mammal populations for each sampling design using a Bayesian and likelihood SCR modeling approach. We compare SCR and ad hoc density estimators using frequentist performance measures. We found Bayesian and likelihood SCR estimates of density D) and abundance N) to be similar. We also found SCR models to have moderately poor frequentist coverage of D and N (45–73\%), high deviation from truth (i.e., accuracy D, 17–29\% N, 16–29\%), and consistent negative bias across inferential paradigms, sampling designs, and models. With the trapping grid data, the basic SCR model generally performed more poorly than the best ad hoc estimator (behavior CR super-population estimate divided by the full mean maximum distance moved estimate of the effective trapping area), whereas with the trapping web data, the best-performing SCR model (null) was comparable to the best distance model. Relatively poor frequentist SCR coverage resulted from higher precision (SCR coefficients of variation [CVs] , ad hoc CVs); howeve D and D were fairly well correlated (r 2 range of 0.77–0.96). SCR's negative relative bias (i.e., average underestimation of the true density) suggests additional heterogeneity in detection and/or that small mammals maintained asymmetric home ranges. We suggest caution in the use of the basic SCR model when trapping animals in a sampling grid and more generally when small sample sizes necessitate the spatial scale parameter (r) apply to all individuals. When possible, researchers should consider variation in detection and incorporate individual biological and/or ecological variation at the trap level when modeling r.},

	abstract = {1. Capture-recapture studies are often conducted on populations that are stratified by space, time or other factrs. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian spatial capture-recapture (SCR) modeling framework for stratified populations-when sampling occurs within multiple distinct spatial and temporal strata.2. We describe a hierarchical model which integrates distinct models for both the spatial encounter history data from capture-recapture sampling, and also for modeling variation in density among strata. We use an implementation of data augmentation to parameterize the model in terms of a latent categorical stratum or group membership variable, which provides a convenient implementation in popular BUGS software packages.3. We provide an example application to an experimental study involving small-mammal sampling on multiple trapping grids over multiple years, where the main interest is in modeling a treatment effect on population density among the trapping grids.4. Many capture-recapture studies involve some aspect of spatial or temporal replication that requires some attention to modeling variation among groups or strata. We propose a hierarchical model that allows explicit modeling of group or strata effects. Because the model is formulated for individual encounter histories, and is easily implemented in the BUGS language and other free software, it also provides a general framework for modeling individual effects such as present in spatial capture-recapture models.This article is protected by copyright.

Trained field staff, randomly assigned to private insurance, Medicaid, or uninsured, called primary care offices requesting the first available appointment for either routine care or an urgent health concern. The study included a stratified random sample of primary care practices treating nonelderly adults within each of 10 states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas), selected for diversity along numerous dimensions. Collectively, these states comprise almost one-third of the US nonelderly, Medicaid, and currently uninsured populations. Sampling was based on enrollment by insurance type by county. Analyses were weighted to obtain population-based estimates for each state.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ability to schedule an appointment and number of days to the appointment. We also examined cost and payment required at the visit for the uninsured.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Between November 13, 2012, and April 4, 2013, we made 12,907 calls to 7788 primary care practices requesting new patient appointments. Across the 10 states, 84.7\% (95\% CI, 82.6\%-86.8\%) of privately insured and 57.9\% (95\% CI, 54.8\%-61.0\%) of Medicaid callers received an appointment. Appointment rates were 78.8\% (95\% CI, 75.6\%-82.0\%) for uninsured patients with full cash payment but only 15.4\% (95\% CI, 13.2\%-17.6\%) if payment required at the time of the visit was restricted to \$75 or less. Conditional on getting an appointment, median wait times were typically less than 1 week (2 weeks in Massachusetts), with no differences by insurance status or urgency of health concern.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although most primary care physicians are accepting new patients, access varies widely across states and insurance status. Navigator programs are needed, not only to help patients enroll but also to identify practices accepting new patients within each plan's network. Tracking new patient appointment availability over time can inform policies designed to strengthen primary care capacity and enhance the effectiveness of the coverage expansions with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.},

	abstract = {Fisheries biology encompasses a tremendous diversity of research questions, methods, and models. Many sub-fields use observational or experi-mental data to make inference about biological characteristics that are not directly observed (called " latent states "), such as heritability of pheno-typic traits, habitat suitability, and population densities to name a few. Latent states will generally cause model residuals to be correlated, violating the assumption of statistical independence made in many statistical modelling approaches. In this exposition, we argue that mixed-effect modelling (i) is an important and generic solution to non-independence caused by latent states; (ii) provides a unifying framework for disparate statistical methods such as time-series, spatial, and individual-based models; and (iii) is increasingly practical to implement and customize for problem-specific models. We proceed by summarizing the distinctions between fixed and random effects, reviewing a generic approach for parameter es-timation, and distinguishing general categories of non-linear mixed-effect models. We then provide four worked examples, including state-space, spatial, individual-level variability, and quantitative genetics applications (with working code for each), while providing comparison with conven-tional fixed-effect implementations. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research in this important framework for modelling and statistical analysis in fisheries biology.},

However, relatively little is known about how these statistics relate to one another and how they relate to prey population dynamics. We assess these relationships across three systems where wolf–prey dynamics have been observed for 41 years (Isle Royale), 19 years (Banff) and 12 years (Yellowstone). 2. To provide context for this empirical assessment, we developed theoretical predictions of the relationship between kill rate and PR under a broad range of predator–prey models including predator-dependent, ratio-dependent and Lotka-Volterra dynamics. 3. The theoretical predictions indicate that kill rate can be related to PR in a variety of diverse ways (e.g. positive, negative, unrelated) that depend on the nature of predator–prey dynamics (e.g. structure of the functional response). These simulations also suggested that the ratio of predator-to-prey is a good predictor of prey growth rate. That result motivated us to assess the empirical relationship between the ratio and prey growth rate for each of the three study sites. 4. The empirical relationships indicate that PR is not well predicted by kill rate, but is better predicted by the ratio of predator-to-prey. Kill rate is also a poor predictor of prey growth rate. However, PR and ratio of predator-to-prey each explained significant portions of variation in prey growth rate for two of the three study sites. 5. Our analyses offer two general insights. First, Isle Royale, Banff and Yellowstone are similar insomuch as they all include wolves preying on large ungulates. However, they also differ in species diversity of predator and prey communities, exploitation by humans and the role of dispersal. Even with the benefit of our analysis, it remains difficult to judge whether to be more impressed by the similarities or differences. This difficulty nicely illustrates a fundamental property of ecological communities. Second, kill rate is the primary statistic for many traditional models of predation. However, our work suggests that kill rate and PR are similarly important for understanding why predation is such a complex process.},

	abstract = {Wildlife data gathered by different monitoring techniques are often combined to estimate animal density. However, methods to check whether different types of data provide consistent information (i.e., can information from one data type be used to predict responses in the other?) before combining them are lacking. We used generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed-effects models to relate camera trap probabilities for marked animals to independent space use from telemetry relocations using 2 years of data for fishers (Pekania pennanti) as a case study. We evaluated (1) camera trap efficacy by estimating how camera detection probabilities are related to nearby telemetry relocations and (2) whether home range utilization density estimated from telemetry data adequately predicts camera detection probabilities, which would indicate consistency of the two data types. The number of telemetry relocations within 250 and 500 m from camera traps predicted detection probability well. For the same number of relocations, females were more likely to be detected during the first year. During the second year, all fishers were more likely to be detected during the fall/winter season. Models predicting camera detection probability and photo counts solely from telemetry utilization density had the best or nearly best Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), suggesting that telemetry and camera traps provide consistent information on space use. Given the same utilization density, males were more likely to be photo-captured due to larger home ranges and higher movement rates. Although methods that combine data types (spatially explicit capture-recapture) make simple assumptions about home range shapes, it is reasonable to conclude that in our case, camera trap data do reflect space use in a manner consistent with telemetry data. However, differences between the 2 years of data suggest that camera efficacy is not fully consistent across ecological conditions and make the case for integrating other sources of space-use data.},

	abstract = {Motion-activated cameras are a versatile tool that wildlife biologists can use for sampling wild animal populations to estimate species occurrence. Occupancy modelling provides a flexible framework for the analysis of these data; explicitly recognizing that given a species occupies an area the probability of detecting it is often less than one. Despite the number of studies using camera data in an occupancy framework, there is only limited guidance from the scientific literature about survey design trade-offs when using motion-activated cameras. A fuller understanding of these trade-offs will allow researchers to maximise available resources and determine whether the objectives of a monitoring program or research study are achievable. We use an empirical dataset collected from 40 cameras deployed across 160 km(2) of the Western Slope of Colorado, USA to explore how survey effort (number of cameras deployed and the length of sampling period) affects the accuracy and precision (i.e., error) of the occupancy estimate for ten mammal and three virtual species. We do this using a simulation approach where species occupancy and detection parameters were informed by empirical data from motion-activated cameras. A total of 54 survey designs were considered by varying combinations of sites (10–120 cameras) and occasions (20–120 survey days). Our findings demonstrate that increasing total sampling effort generally decreases error associated with the occupancy estimate, but changing the number of sites or sampling duration can have very different results, depending on whether a species is spatially common or rare (occupancy = ψ) and easy or hard to detect when available (detection probability = p). For rare species with a low probability of detection (i.e., raccoon and spotted skunk) the required survey effort includes maximizing the number of sites and the number of survey days, often to a level that may be logistically unrealistic for many studies. For common species with low detection (i.e., bobcat and coyote) the most efficient sampling approach was to increase the number of occasions (survey days). However, for common species that are moderately detectable (i.e., cottontail rabbit and mule deer), occupancy could reliably be estimated with comparatively low numbers of cameras over a short sampling period. We provide general guidelines for reliably estimating occupancy across a range of terrestrial species (rare to common: ψ = 0.175–0.970, and low to moderate detectability: p = 0.003–0.200) using motion-activated cameras. Wildlife researchers/managers with limited knowledge of the relative abundance and likelihood of detection of a particular species can apply these guidelines regardless of location. We emphasize the importance of prior biological knowledge, defined objectives and detailed planning (e.g., simulating different study-design scenarios) for designing effective monitoring programs and research studies.},

We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables},

Using a data set on the past and current status of brown bears (Ursus arctos), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), gray wolves (Canis lupus), and wolverines (Gulo gulo) in European countries, we show that roughly one-third of mainland Europe hosts at least one large carnivore species, with stable or increasing abundance in most cases in 21st-century records. The reasons for this overall conservation success include protective legislation, supportive public opinion, and a variety of practices making coexistence between large carnivores and people possible. The European situation reveals that large carnivores and people can share the same landscape.{\textbackslash}nSuccess for Europe's large carnivores?{\textbackslash}nDespite pessimistic forecasts, Europe's large carnivores are making a comeback. Chapron et al. report that sustainable populations of brown bear, Eurasian lynx, gray wolf, and wolverine persist in one-third of mainland Europe. Moreover, many individuals and populations are surviving and increasing outside protected areas set aside for wildlife conservation. Coexistence alongside humans has become possible, argue the authors, because of improved public opinion and protective legislation.{\textbackslash}nScience, this issue p. 1517},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.12432},
	abstract = {1. Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. 2. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objec- tives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analyti- cal assumptions and species ecology. 3. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence–absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. 4. Most studies estimating density used capture–recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abun- dance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between mea- sured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). 5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting tran- sition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology’s promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, move- ment and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliabil- ity of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet mod- ern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.},

We combine bibliometric information from a literature review of almost 16,500 peer-reviewed publications on a well-known group of 286 species, the Order Carnivora, with global datasets on species' life history and ecological traits to explore patterns in research effort. Our study explores how species' characteristics influenced the degree to which they were studied (measured as the number of publications). We identified a wide variation in intensity of research effort at both Family and Species levels, with some of the least studied being those which may need protection in future. Our findings hint at the complex role of human perspectives in setting research agendas. We found that better-studied species tended to be large-bodied and have a large geographic range whilst omnivory had a negative relationship with research effort. IUCN threat status did not exhibit a strong relationship with research effort which suggests that the conservation needs of individual species are not major drivers of research interest. This work is the first to use a combination of bibliometric analysis and biological data to quantify and interpret gaps in research knowledge across an entire Order. Our results could be combined with other resources, such as Biodiversity Action Plans, to prioritise and co-ordinate future research effort, whilst our methods can be applied across many scientific disciplines to describe knowledge gaps.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Moreover, the physiological and genetic underpinnings of SSB remain unclear. We exploited an extraordinary natural experiment to examine the impact of environmental factors (local sex ratio [SR]) and testosterone (T) levels on SSB in a dense population of Hermanns tortoises monitored for 7 years. Under the combination of high density and extremely skewed SR ({\textasciitilde}50 females, {\textgreater}1000 males), males courted and mounted other males more frequently than females. They even exhibited extravagant sexual behaviors, attempting to copulate with dead conspecifics, empty shells, and stones. T levels remained within the species normal range of variation. SSB was not observed in other populations where SR is not, or less skewed, and where density is lower. This study reports the first natural example of a "prison effect," whereby a high population density combined with female deprivation triggered SSB as a mere outlet of sexual stimulation. More generally, it supports the hypothesis that SSB can be a nonadaptive consequence of unusual proximate factors rather than reflecting physiological disorders.},

	abstract = {Asian bears face major threats due to the impact of human activities as well as a critical lack of knowledge about their status, distribution and needs for survival. Once abundant in northern Pakistan, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has been exterminated in most of its former distribution range. It presently occurs sparsely, in small populations, the Deosai National Park supporting the largest isolate. This decline might imply a reduction in genetic diversity, compromising the survival of the population. Using a combination of fecal DNA analysis and field data, our study aimed at assessing the size and genetic status of the Deosai population and give guidelines for its conservation and management. Using fecal genetic analysis, we estimated the population to be 40-50 bears, which compares well with the field census of 38 bears. The northern Pakistani brown bear population may have undergone an approximate 200-300-fold decrease during the last thousand years, probably due to glaciations and the influence of growing human population. However, in spite of the presence of a bottleneck genetic signature, the Deosai population has a moderate level of genetic diversity and is not at immediate risk of inbreeding depression. Gene flow might exist with adjacent populations. We recommend careful monitoring of this population in the future both with field observations and genetic analyses, including sampling of adjacent populations to assess incoming gene flow. The connectivity with adjacent populations in Pakistan and India will be of prime importance for the long-term survival of Deosai bears. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ranges of wolves (Canis lupus) and bears (Ursus arctos) across Europe have expanded recently, and it is important to assess public attitudes toward this expansion because responses toward these species vary widely. General attitudes toward an object are good predictors of broad behavioral patterns; thus, attitudes toward wolves and bears can be used as indicators to assess the social foundation for future conservation efforts. However, most attitude surveys toward bears and wolves are limited in scope, both temporally and spatially, and provide only a snapshot of attitudes. To extend the results of individual surveys over a much larger temporal and geographical range so as to identify transnational patterns and changes in attitudes toward bears and wolves over time, we conducted a meta-analysis. Our analysis included 105 quantitative surveys conducted in 24 countries from 1976 to 2012. Across Europe, people's attitudes were more positive toward bears than wolves. Attitudes toward bears became more positive over time, but attitudes toward wolves seemed to become less favorable the longer people coexisted with them. Younger and more educated people had more positive attitudes toward wolves and bears than people who had experienced damage from these species, and farmers and hunters had less positive attitudes toward wolves than the general public. For bears attitudes among social groups did not differ. To inform conservation of large carnivores, we recommend that standardized longitudinal surveys be established to monitor changes in attitudes over time relative to carnivore population development. Our results emphasize the need for interdisciplinary research in this field and more advanced explanatory models capable of capturing individual and societal responses to changes in large carnivore policy and management.},

Indirect sampling, by counting spoor, could provide repeatable and inexpensive measures of some population parameters. The relationship between true population density and indirect sampling results has seldom been described in large carnivore studies. 3. In northern Namibia the population densities of leopards, lions and wild dogs were measured through recognition of individuals and groups. Spoor counts were then conducted independently, to assess the relationship between true density and the distribution of spoor. 4. Sampling effort, both in terms of the number of roads and total road distance in a sample zone, and the intensity of sampling, had a marked effect on the accuracy and precision of spoor frequency calculations. 5. In a homogeneous habitat, leopard spoor were evenly spread along different roads and spoor frequency was independent of road length. Taking into account very low sample sizes, the spoor density of leopards, lions and wild dogs showed a strong linear correlation with true density. The slope of the regression for leopards was different to that of lions and wild dogs.},

The widely applied genotype mismatch (MM) method, however, is inaccurate because it relies on a fixed and suboptimal threshold number (TM) of mismatches, and often yields self-inconsistent pairwise inferences. In this study, I improved MM method by calculating an optimal TM to accommodate the number, mistyping rates, missing data and allele frequencies of the markers. I also developed a pairwise likelihood relationship (LR) method and a likelihood clustering (LC) method for individual identification, using poor-quality data that may have high and variable rates of allelic dropouts and false alleles at genotyped loci. The 3 methods together with the relatedness (RL) method were then compared in accuracy by analysing an empirical frog data set and many simulated data sets generated under different parameter combinations. The analysis results showed that LC is generally one or two orders more accurate for individual identification than the other methods. Its accuracy is especially superior when the sampled multilocus genotypes have poor quality (i.e. teemed with genotyping errors and missing data) and highly replicated, a situation typical of noninvasive sampling used in estimating population size. Importantly, LC is the only method that guarantees to produce self-consistent results by partitioning the entire set of multilocus genotypes into distinct clusters, each cluster containing one or more genotypes that all represent the same individual. The LC and LR methods were implemented in a computer program COLONY for free download from the Internet.},

The distance to the niche centroid approach (DNC) is a methodological development toward better understanding how the internal structure of species' ecological niches is related to geographic patterns of abundance. We evaluated this approach under combinations of three sampling scenarios and three sampling intensities for a hypothetical species for which abundance patterns were ideal and strictly controlled. Our results indicate that predictive ability of the DNC approach increased with sample intensity, particularly under a strict random sampling scheme. Model performance under a sampling scenario biased by species' density fell slightly, but was importantly reduced when the source of the biases were attractor sites unrelated with species' traits. We conclude that the DNC approach is only suitable to model species' abundances/densities under particular conditions. First because it is necessary fulfill some assumptions (discussed in this paper), and second because its performance strongly depends on sampling characteristics that are unusual in most biodiversity data.},

	abstract = {As an apex predator the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica Temminck, 1844) could play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of forest ecosystems in Northeast Asia. Due to habitat loss and harvest over the past century, tigers rapidly declined in China and are now restricted to the Russian Far East and bordering habitat in nearby China. To facilitate restoration of the tiger in its historical range, reliable estimates of population size are essential to assess effectiveness of conservation interventions. Here we used camera trap data collected in Hunchun National Nature Reserve from April to June of 2013 and 2014 to estimate tiger density and abundance using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods. A minimum of eight individuals were detected in both sample periods and the documentation of marking behavior and reproduction suggests the presence of a resident population. Using Bayesian SECR modeling within the 11,400 km(2) state space, density estimates were 0.33 and 0.40 individuals/100 km(2) in 2013 and 2014, respectively, corresponding to an estimated abundance of 38 and 45 animals for this transboundary Sino-Russia population. In a maximum likelihood framework, we estimated densities of 0.30 and 0.24 individuals/100 km(2) corresponding to abundances of 34 and 27, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. These density estimates are comparable to other published estimates for resident Amur tiger populations in the Russian Far East. This study reveals promising signs of tiger recovery in Northeast China, and demonstrates the importance of connectivity between the Russian and Chinese populations for recovering tigers in Northeast China.

	abstract = {Many ecological theories and species conservation programmes rely on accurate estimates of population density. Accurate density estimation, especially for species facing rapid declines, requires the application of rigorous field and analytical methods. However, obtaining accurate density estimates of carnivores can be challenging as carnivores naturally exist at relatively low densities and are often elusive and wide-ranging. In this study, we employ an unstructured spatial sampling field design along with a Bayesian sex-specific spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analysis, to provide the first rigorous population density estimates of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Maasai Mara, Kenya. We estimate adult cheetah density to be between 1.28 � 0.315 and 1.34 � 0.337 individuals/100km2 across four candidate models specified in our analysis. Our spatially explicit approach revealed ?hotspots? of cheetah density, highlighting that cheetah are distributed heterogeneously across the landscape. The SECR models incorporated a movement range parameter which indicated that male cheetah moved four times as much as females, possibly because female movement was restricted by their reproductive status and/or the spatial distribution of prey. We show that SECR can be used for spatially unstructured data to successfully characterise the spatial distribution of a low density species and also estimate population density when sample size is small. Our sampling and modelling framework will help determine spatial and temporal variation in cheetah densities, providing a foundation for their conservation and management. Based on our results we encourage other researchers to adopt a similar approach in estimating densities of individually recognisable species.},

	abstract = {Logistic regression models integrating disease presence/absence data are widely used to identify risk factors for a given disease. However, when data arise from imperfect surveillance systems, the interpretation of results is confusing since explanatory variables can be related either to the occurrence of the disease or to the efficiency of the surveillance system. As an alternative, we present spatial and non-spatial zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regressions for modelling the number of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks that were reported at subdistrict level in Thailand during the second epidemic wave (July 3rd 2004 to May 5th 2005). The spatial ZIP model fitted the data more effectively than its non-spatial version. This model clarified the role of the different variables: for example, results suggested that human population density was not associated with the disease occurrence but was rather associated with the number of reported outbreaks given disease occurrence. In addition, these models allowed estimating that 902 (95\% CI 881-922) subdistricts suffered at least one HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Thailand although only 779 were reported to veterinary authorities, leading to a general surveillance sensitivity of 86.4\% (95\% CI 84.5-88.4). Finally, the outputs of the spatial ZIP model revealed the spatial distribution of the probability that a subdistrict could have been a false negative. The methodology presented here can easily be adapted to other animal health contexts. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Major landscape transformations have occurred in the northern Mediterranean over the last decades, including urbanization, agricultural intensification and land abandonment, which, in turn, increase the risk of the propagation of fire. We used repeated-count surveys conducted at 369 sites in France and Spain to jointly model the effects of environmental covariates on the abundance, occupancy and detection of Hermann's tortoise, a long-lived and endangered species, using a novel zero-inflated approach. We also employed a large dataset of presence-only data collected in Provence to model environmental influences on occurrence probability using maximum entropy models. In both France and Spain, sites that experienced wildfires over the last 50. years hosted 31\% fewer individuals than unburned sites. In Provence, higher wildfire frequency decreased this species' occurrence probability, from 50\% when 0-1 fire had occurred over the last 50. years, to 7\% in areas that had burned at least 3 times. We also showed that abundance required a long recovery time (more than 25. years) after wildfires. In Provence, the highest occurrence probability for this species was found in patchy landscapes and scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation. The lowest species occurrence was found in extensive artificial areas, vineyards and arable lands. These results suggest a high risk of population extinction in the future if these types of habitats continue to expand in plains and coastal areas to the detriment of scrublands. Higher wildfire frequency predicted by climate change scenarios in the Mediterranean is also likely to increase the risk of extinction for some populations. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to measure the habitat architecture of the six algal species and relate this to the molluscan assemblages, several structural attributes were calculated on each individual plant. There were differences in architectural attributes between the six algal species, with data recorded for S . vulgare and H . scoparia more similar to data for C . barbatula and C . spinosa (which grouped closely), than for the two species belonging to the genus Dictyota , which had a less complex structure. A total of 1,914 specimens and 57 species of molluscs were found on the collected algae. The abundance and diversity of the molluscan assemblages were significantly different between different macroalgae. In general S . vulgare , C . barbatula and C . spinosa supported a higher abundance, greater number of species, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and Margalef's index than the remaining three algal species. Both multivariate analyses (i.e. cluster and multidimensional scaling) and a posteriori tests (Student-Neuman-Keuls' test) demonstrated that samples collected on D . dichotoma were well separated, reflecting the lowest values of abundance and diversity. The molluscan assemblage data were also correlated to the attributes of algal architecture revealing that the combination of degree of branching, algal width and the log of the stem width provides a good explanation for molluscan structure. Differences in the molluscan assemblages of these six common Mediterranean algae can be attributed to different algal architectures, and, consequently, these could be related to the supposed variations in food availability and predation rate.},

	abstract = {In most ecological studies, within-group variation is a nuisance that obscures patterns of interest and reduces statistical power. However, patterns of within-group variability often contain information about ecological processes. In particular, such patterns can be used to detect positive growth autocorrelation (consistent variation in growth rates among individuals in a cohort across time), even in samples of unmarked individuals. Previous methods for detecting autocorrelated growth required data from marked individuals. We propose a method that requires only estimates of within-cohort variance through time, using maximum likelihood methods to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals of the correlation parameter. We test our method on simulated data sets and determine the loss in statistical power due to the inability to identify individuals. We show how to accommodate nonlinear growth trajectories and test the effects of size-dependent mortality on our method's accuracy. The method can detect significant growth autocorrelation at moderate levels of autocorrelation with moderate-sized cohorts (for example, statistical power of 80\% to detect growth autocorrelation ρ (2) = 0.5 in a cohort of 100 individuals measured on 16 occasions). We present a case study of growth in the red-eyed tree frog. Better quantification of the processes driving size variation will help ecologists improve predictions of population dynamics. This work will help researchers to detect growth autocorrelation in cases where marking is logistically infeasible or causes unacceptable decreases in the fitness of marked individuals.},

The first generation includes the collagen-based synthetic device, Integra, and Alloderm, which is based on devitalised and cross-linked human dermis. These are used as dermal replacements for third degree burns. Within the last year, the tissue-engineered product, Dermagraft-TC, has become available. While originally intended as a temporary covering for severe burns, Dermagraft-TC has proved to markedly improve the healing of deep second degree burns. The earliest living skin substitutes used autologous keratinocytes expanded in vitro. Two new products containing living cells, Dermagraft and Apligraf, are expected to be approved shortly for diabetic foot ulcers and venous stasis ulcers, respectively. Dermagraft is produced by growing human fibroblasts on a three-dimensional scaffold. The cells actively proliferate and lay down extracellular matrix to generate a papillary dermis-like device that shows a combination of angiogenic, growth factor and cell adhesion properties that enhance healing in diabetic foot ulcers. The production of Apligraf includes casting human fibroblasts in collagen, in order to generate a dermal equivalent on which is grown an epidermis. The structure is akin to a skin graft and is so applied. Despite Dermagraft and Apligraf being of allogeneic origin, rejection has not been an issue in clinical trials and possible contamination by pathogens has been eliminated as a concern through extensive testing. These developments represent a new concept and are expected to revolutionise wound care. They may also provide a platform for gene therapy applications.},

	abstract = {Understanding factors that govern the abundance of organisms is fundamental to the science of ecology and important for conservation and management of species. I used temporal and spatial comparisons to test the influence of human industrial activity, huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) productivity, and population density on grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) vital rates and population trends over a 32-year period. Survival rates of adult and subadult males were 0.84 and 0.78, respectively, and lower than those of adult (0.93) or subadult females (0.96). Of the 31 bears that died while radio-collared, 26 (84\%) were killed by people. Of those killed by people, 11 (35\%) were legally killed by hunters and 84\% were deaths that occurred {\textless}120mfrom a road. In the first decade of study (1979–1988) when salvage logging and gas exploration was intensive, bear density was relatively low, and huckleberry production was generally good, the population increased (l¼1.074) with high survival rates of cubs (0.84) and yearlings (0.86) plus a high reproductive rate of 0.374. During the second decade (1989–1998) when there was little industrial activity and huckleberry production remained good, the population continued to grow (l?1.06–1.08) because survival of all age classes remained high, but the reproductive rate declined to 0.257. Bear density reached its maximum (55.6 bears/1,000km2 excluding independent males) at the start of the third decade. During the third decade (1999–2010), there was little industrial activity, but huckleberry production declined dramatically and often completely failed. During the third decade the population declined (l?0.955–0.980) as the reproductive rate dropped to 0.192 because of small litters (1.82), extended interbirth intervals (2.93, 3.44, and 4.22 years in decades 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and increased age of primiparity (6.60, 7.09, and 10.46 years in decades 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Adult female survival also declined likely because more females were without offspring and thus vulnerable to hunting. The best model predicting if a parous female would have a small (0 or 1 cub) or large (2 or 3 cub) litter when not encumbered with offspring the previous mating season included both huckleberry abundance the previous year and female bear density. Population inventories during the third decade had approximately twice as many bears detected per DNA hair trap set in the portion of the valley where there had been rapid industrial development, grizzly bear hunting, and large huckleberry fields than in an adjacent portion of the valley that was protected from industry and hunting but with nomajor huckleberry fields. The abundance of huckleberries growing in mountains above most human activity permitted this population to expand in spite of the industrial development. The population was primarily regulated by the interaction of bear density and the density-independent production of huckleberries, their major summer-fall energy food},

	abstract = {In capture-recapture and mark-resight surveys, movements of individuals both within and between sampling periods can alter the susceptibility of individuals to detection over the region of sampling. In these circumstances spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models, which incorporate the observed locations of individuals, allow population density and abundance to be estimated while accounting for differences in detectability of individuals. In this paper I propose two Bayesian SECR models, one for the analysis of recaptures observed in trapping arrays and another for the analysis of recaptures observed in area searches. In formulating these models I used distinct submodels to specify the distribution of individual home-range centers and the observable recaptures associated with these individuals. This separation of ecological and observational processes allowed me to derive a formal connection between Bayes and empirical Bayes estimators of population abundance that has not been established previously. I showed that this connection applies to every Poisson point-process model of SECR data and provides theoretical support for a previously proposed estimator of abundance based on recaptures in trapping arrays. To illustrate results of both classical and Bayesian methods of analysis, I compared Bayes and empirical Bayes esimates of abundance and density using recaptures from simulated and real populations of animals. Real populations included two iconic datasets: recaptures of tigers detected in camera-trap surveys and recaptures of lizards detected in area-search surveys. In the datasets I analyzed, classical and Bayesian methods provided similar - and often identical - inferences, which is not surprising given the sample sizes and the noninformative priors used in the analyses.},

We compared density estimates of ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) derived from fecal noninvasive genetic techniques to density estimates from camera trapping in the same population, during the same study period. Density estimates from the two techniques were comparable, especially when using spatially explicit capture-recapture models. Population density estimated using the program DENSITY was 1.74/km 2 (SE = 0.584) from noninvasive genetics and 1.59/km 2 (SE = 0.464) from camera trapping.

	abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

The study area was approximately 315 ha of coastal plantation for- est surrounded on 3 sides by sand and water. We placed 4 lines of 9 cage traps at 20-m spacing in a square to form a “hollow grid.” We set 5 hollow grids, each comprising 36 traps, for 5 days; we tagged and released possums. We later set 5 trapping webs of 50 traps each at the same sites; we caught possums and removed them over 4 days. Wide- area removal used a combination of acute poisoning and leghold trapping. The estimate of density by inverse prediction (1.88/ha, SE = 0.26) was consistent with the removal esti- mate (2.27/ha), whereas estimates from trapping webs were positively biased (6.5 to 8.0/ha, depending on method of analysis). The inverse prediction method frees cap- ture–recapture from the straitjacket of conventional grids and should allow accurate land- scape-scale estimation of density once the requisite trapping effort is identified.},

	abstract = {* 1We sought evidence among the plant species of a New Zealand sand dune community that limiting similarity controls the ability of species to coexist. Sampling was at four spatial scales, from a single point up to a scale of 50 m2. Twenty-three functional characters were measured on each of the species, covering the morphology of the shoot and root systems and nutrient status, and intended to represent modes of resource acquisition. * 2Patterns of association between plant species at the four scales were examined for any tendency for plants with similar functional characters to coexist less often than expected at random (e.g. if a point has three species, do they have notably different characters?) The observed results were compared with the patterns expected under a null model using a range of test statistics. * 3A test over all characters found that the mean dissimilarity between nearest-neighbour species in functional space, and the minimum dissimilarity, were greater than expected under the null model at the 0.5 × 0.5 m scale. This supports the MacArthur \& Levins model, although the actual community did not show an even spread of species over functional space. * 4Limiting similarity effects were seen even more consistently in separate characters when within-species variation was taken into account to calculate measures of overlap. The characters involved were mainly those related to rooting patterns and leaf water control, and thus perhaps reflecting the acquisition of nutrients and/or water. * 5Our results seem to be amongst the most convincing support for the theory of limiting similarity, and the only example involving vegetative processes in plant communities. The characters involved suggest that species can more readily coexist if they differ in their water-use pattern, reducing competition between them.},

In the past few years, camera trapping and mark–recapture statistics have been used to estimate the density of a number of felids. Although camera trapping is now providing baseline data formanagers and conservationists alike, recent doubts have been raised concerning the accuracy of the standard camera trapping procedure. We used radio telemetry to gain new information on ocelot home-range size and spatial organization in Central America, and compared the radius of our average ocelot home range with the standard camera trapping buffer. We compared the resulting density estimates to assess the current camera trapping methodology’s ability to estimate animal density. Five adult ocelots (two male and three female) were tracked to determine an average ocelot home range of 26.09km2 (95\% fixed kernel) and 18.91km2 (100\% minimum convex polygon), with males demonstrat- ing larger ranges than females. All ocelots had larger home ranges in the dry season. Male–male home-range overlap averaged 9\% while female–female overlap aver- aged 21\%. Males shared 56\% of their range with a primary female and 16\%with a second and third female, while females shared 58\% of their home range with a primary male and 3\% with a secondary male. Density estimates based on the average home-range radius (11.24–12.45 ocelots per 100km2) were less than those determined from standard camera trapping methods (25.88 ocelots per 100km2), but similar to those determined using twice the camera trapping buffer to estimate density (12.61 ocelots per 100km2). Our results suggest that a standard camera trapping protocol may overestimate ocelot density. Accurate representation of animal densities and standardization of density estimation techniques are para- mount for comparative analyses across sites and are vital for felid conservation.},

	abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) represent the single, unified analysis of population count data and demographic data. This modelling framework is quite novel and can be implemented within the classical or the Bayesian mode of statistical inference. Here, we briefly show the basic steps that need to be taken when an inte- grated population model is adopted, and review existing integrated population models for birds and mammals. There are important advantages of integrated compared to conventional analyses that analyse each dataset separately and then try to make an inference about population dynamics. First, integrated population models allow the estimating of more demographic quantities, because there is information about all demographic processes operating in a population, and this information is exploited. Second, parameter estimates become more precise, and this enhances statistical power. Finally, all sources of uncer- tainty due to process variability and the sampling pro- cess(es) are adequately included. Core of the integrated models is the link of changes in the population size and the demographic rates via a demographic model (usually a Leslie matrix model) and the likelihoods of all existing datasets. We discuss some critical assumptions that are typically made in integrated population models and high- light fruitful areas of future research. Currently, we have found 25 studies that used integrated population models. Central to most studies was statistical development rather than their application to address an ecological question, which is not surprising given that integrated population models are still a new development. We predict that inte- grated population models will become a common and important tool in studies of population dynamics, both in ecology and its applications, such as conservation biology or wildlife management.},

	abstract = {Density estimates for small-mammal populations from capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data have played an important role in many studies of theoretical and applied ecology. Defining effective trapping area (ETA) is one of the main issues affecting accuracy of density estimates. Our objective was to assess sensitivity of CMR density estimates to correctors based on movement parameters calculated from trapping and radiotelemetry data. From May to November 2005, we conducted monthly CMR trapping in a beech (Fagus sylvaticus) forest of the province of Trento, northern Italy. In conjunction with CMR, we radiomarked 32 yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) captured from July to October and located them daily using radiotelemetry. We estimated population size (N) by model averaging with Program MARK. We calculated ETA using several definitions of the boundary strip, including full and half mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) from capture-recapture and telemetry data and mean radius of mean monthly home ranges. The boundary strip (W) increased with the amount of behavioral information embodied in the estimates. The largest W and lowest density values were based on radius of mean home ranges followed by MMDM calculated from telemetry data. The ETA based on movement distances increased more than proportionally when N decreased, suggesting that low population density combined with scarce resources results in rodents moving more in search of food, thus leading to overestimated ETA and underestimated density values. Although robust behavioral information would certainly improve density estimates, we suggest caution in relating ranging movements to capture probability and hence in using correctors based on movement distances to infer density values.

	abstract = {Effective approaches for the management and conservation of wildlife populations require a sound knowledge of population demographics, and this is often only possible through mark-recapture studies. We applied an automated spot-recognition program (I3S) for matching natural markings of wildlife that is based on a novel information-theoretic approach to incorporate matching uncertainty. Using a photo-identification database of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) as an example case, the information criterion (IC) algorithm we developed resulted in a parsimonious ranking of potential matches of individuals in an image library. Automated matches were compared to manual-matching results to test the performance of the software and algorithm. RESULTS: Validation of matched and non-matched images provided a threshold IC weight (approximately 0.2) below which match certainty was not assured. Most images tested were assigned correctly; however, scores for the by-eye comparison were lower than expected, possibly due to the low sample size. The effect of increasing horizontal angle of sharks in images reduced matching likelihood considerably. There was a negative linear relationship between the number of matching spot pairs and matching score, but this relationship disappeared when using the IC algorithm. CONCLUSION: The software and use of easily applied information-theoretic scores of match parsimony provide a reliable and freely available method for individual identification of wildlife, with wide applications and the potential to improve mark-recapture studies without resorting to invasive marking techniques.},

	abstract = {1. With the global population of beavers (Castor spp.) increasing, and reintroductions widespread, it is crucial to be able to predict potential impacts on flora and fauna based on defined foraging behaviours. 2. Nymphaea alba (white water lily) is regularly consumed by beavers and provides a model system to test selective foraging behaviour and quantify potential impacts on aquatic resources in standing-water habitats. 3. Using biometric relationships within N.alba pads, we accurately reconstructed the size and weight of consumed pads, demonstrating that beavers (Castor fiber) selected pads that were significantly larger and heavier than unselected pads. By selecting larger leaves, beavers may also avoid chemical defences associated with anthocyanin pigments that dominate in smaller leaves. Grazing was concentrated in shallow depths (55.710.7cm) close to the shore (2.950.62m) relative to ungrazed plots (100.5 +/- 9.2cm; 4.79 +/- 0.68m). The level of selectivity was unchanged with increasing distance from a central feeding place. 4. Beavers removed 24-50\% of pads within grazed areas, but relative to the whole N.alba leaf pad resource, the impact of this foraging was low (0.38-1.23\% loss). Plant species diversity was unaffected by foraging, and there was no evidence of indirect effects on non-targeted N.alba pads or flowers. 5. When foraging in the aquatic environment, beavers are highly selective and can have a minor effect on food resources whilst feeding optimally and opportunistically. Since beavers demonstrate adaptive foraging strategies depending on their foraging environment, this knowledge should be incorporated into future decisions on further reintroduction or habitat restoration programmes.},

Two situations are likely to occur, either that this identifiable population is representative of the whole popula- tion, or that it has been obtained by sampling by the method under study.

	abstract = {The tiger (Panthera tigris) is an endangered, large felid whose demographic status is poorly known across its distributional range in Asia. Previously applied methods for estimating tiger abundance, using total counts based on tracks, have proved unreliable. Lack of reliable data on tiger densities not only has constrained our ability to understand the ecological factors shaping communities of large, solitary felids, but also has undermined the effective conservation of these animals. In this paper, we describe the use of a field method proposed by Karanth (1995), which combines camera-trap photography, to identify individual tigers, with theoretically well-founded capture–recapture models. We developed a sampling design for camera-trapping and used the approach to estimate tiger population size and density in four representative tiger habitats in different parts of India. The field method worked well and provided data suitable for analysis using closed capture–recapture models. The results suggest the potential for applying this methodology to rigorously estimate abundances, survival rates, and other population parameters for tigers and other low-density, secretive animal species in which individuals can be identified based on natural markings. Estimated probabilities of photo-capturing tigers present in the study sites ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Estimated densities of tigers {\textgreater}1 yr old ranged from 4.1 +\_ 1.31 to 16.8 +\_ 2.96 tigers/100 km2 (mean +\_ 1 SE). Simultaneously, we used line-transect sampling to determine that mean densities of principal tiger prey at these sites ranged from 56.1 to 63.8 ungulates/km2 . Tiger densities appear to be positively associated with prey densities, except at one site influenced by tiger poaching. Our results generally support the prediction that relative abundances of large felid species may be governed primarily by the abundance and structure of their prey communities.},

	abstract = {The use of species distribution models to understand and predict species' distributions necessitates tests of fit to empirical data. Numerous performance metrics have been proposed, many of which require continuous occurrence probabilities to be converted to binary ‘present or absent’ predictions using threshold transformations. It is widely accepted that both continuous and binary performance metrics should be independent of prevalence (the proportion of locations that are occupied). However, because these metrics have been mostly assessed on a case-specific basis, there are few general guidelines for measuring performance. Here, we develop a conceptual framework for classifying performance metrics, based on whether they are sensitive to prevalence, and whether they require binary predictions. We use this framework to investigate how these performance metric properties influence the predictions made by the models they select. A literature survey reveals that binary metrics are widely employed and that prevalence-independent metrics are used more frequently than prevalence-dependent metrics. However, we show that prevalence-dependent metrics are essential to assess the numerical accuracy of model predictions and are more useful in applications that require occupancy estimates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in comparison with continuous metrics, binary metrics often select models that have reduced ability to separate presences from absences, make predictions which over- or underestimate occupancy and give misleading estimates of uncertainty. Importantly, models selected using binary metrics will often be of reduced practical use even when applied to ecological problems that require binary decision-making. We suggest that SDM performance should be assessed using prevalence-dependent performance metrics whenever the absolute values of occurrence predictions are important and that continuous metrics should be used instead of binary metrics whenever possible. We thus recommend the wider application of prevalence-dependent continuous metrics, particularly likelihood-based metrics such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), to assess the performance of presence–absence models.},

More recently, Bayesian methods using full likelihoods have been implemented via reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (RJMCMC) or data augmentation (DA). The latter approach is easily implemented in available software and has been applied to fit models that allow for heterogeneity in both open and closed populations. However, both RJMCMC and DA may be inefficient when modelling large populations. * We describe an alternative approach using Monte Carlo (MC) integration to approximate the posterior density within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme. We show how this Monte Carlo within MCMC (MCWM) approach may be used to fit a simple, closed population model including a single individual covariate and present results from a simulation study comparing RJMCMC, DA and MCWM. We found that MCWM can provide accurate inference about population size and can be more efficient than both RJMCMC and DA. The efficiency of MCWM can also be improved by using advanced MC methods like antithetic sampling. * Finally, we apply MCWM to estimate the abundance of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in 1982 allowing for capture probabilities to vary as a function body mass.},

	abstract = {It is critical to know accurately the ecological and geographic range of rare and endangered species for biodiversity conservation and management. In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: . Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences), . Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and . Santalum insulare var. . raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the causes of this discrepancy are strong anthropogenic disturbances that have impacted low- to mid-elevation forests in the past and present. There is an urgent need to set up conservation strategies for the endangered plants found in these shrinking habitats on the Pacific islands. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Although capture-recapture techniques are often used to estimate population size, these approaches are difficult to implement for a wide variety of species. Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers are useful in individual identification, and these 'molecular tags' can be collected without having to capture or trap the individual. However, several sources of error associated with molecular identification techniques, including failure to identify individuals with the same genotype for these markers as being different, and incorrect assignment of individual genotypes, could bias population estimates. Simulations of populations sampled for the purpose of estimating population size were used to assess the extent of these potential biases. Population estimates tended to be biased downward as the likelihood of individuals sharing the same genotype increased (as measured by the probability of identity (PI) of the multi-locus genotype); this bias increased with population size. Populations of 1000 individuals were underestimated by greater than or equal to 5\% when the PI was as small as 1.4 x 10(-7). A similar-sized bias did not occur for populations of 50 individuals until the PI had increased to approximately 2.5 x 10(-5). Errors in genotype assignment resulted in overestimates of population size; this problem increased with the number of samples and loci that were genotyped. Population estimates were often {\textgreater}200\% the size of the simulated populations when the probability of making a genotyping error was 0.05/locus and 7-10 loci were used to identify individuals. This bias was substantially reduced by decreasing genotyping error rate to 0.005. If possible, only highly polymorphic loci that are critical for the identification of the individual should be used in molecular tagging, and considerable efforts should be made to minimize errors in genotype determination.},

For faecal genotypes from wolves in Yellowstone National Park, error rates varied substantially among samples, often above the 'worst-case threshold' suggested by simulation. Consequently, a substantial proportion of multilocus genotypes held one or more errors, despite multiple PCR. These genotyping errors created several genotypes per individual and caused overestimation (up to 5.5-fold) of population size.

	abstract = {1. The ecological niche is a fundamental biological concept. Modelling species' niches is central to numerous ecological applications, including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species' ranges. 2. A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species' environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates. 3. We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence data and are comparable in empirical tests. 4. Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning, management and conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species' potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape alteration},

This often takes place in the absence of reliable information on the population size, and as a consequence, quotas are set in an arbitrary fashion, leading to population decline and revenue loss. In this investigation, we show how an indirect measure of abundance can be used to set quotas in a sustainable manner, even in the absence of information on population size. Focusing on lion hunting in Africa, we developed a simple algorithm to convert changes in the number of safari days required to kill a lion into a quota for the following year. This was tested against a simulation model of population dynamics, accounting for uncertainties in demography, observation, and implementation. Results showed it to reliably set sustainable quotas despite these uncertainties, providing a robust foundation for the conservation of hunted species.},

Carothers' method identifies by simulation and inverse prediction the parametric survival rate, the mean capture probability (E(p)), and CV(p) that could have given rise to an observed set of capture histories and biased capture-recapture estimates. We also extend Carothers' approach to estimate population size and evaluate it in relation to field data from a study of brushtail possums in New Zealand. If heterogeneity is the only source of bias and it is adequately modelled by a beta distribution, the method provides unbiased estimates of average population size, average survival rate, E(p), and CV(p) under the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model.

	abstract = {The brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Croatia is currently being managed through trophy hunting, with quotas allocated to local hunting organisations. Human-bear conflict is present at a low level, but any losses are compensated by the hunting organisations that benefit from bear hunting. Attitudes towards bears are generally positive, and the bear population appears stable, or even increasing. Croatia's current bear hunting policy relies upon both the ecological sustainability of the quotas and the economic sustainability of the hunting organisations. To address the first of these pillars of current policy, we used a two-sex matrix model of the bear population to investigate the biological sustainability of current hunting levels. The model suggests that if the annual allocated quota were fully realised, the population would suffer a considerable decrease over 10 years. A likely explanation for the mismatch between this result and the observed stability of the population is that the bear population size is underestimated. To address the second pillar, we quantified the current structure, costs and benefits of bear hunting to hunting organisations through an interview survey with hunting managers. We found that bear hunting is a substantial component of hunting organisations' income, supporting the other activities of the organisation. Croatia's recent accession to the EU will require changes in their bear management system, potentially stopping bear trophy hunting. Therefore, we assessed the changes in hunting organisations' budgets in the absence of bear hunting. Our results demonstrate that a loss of bear trophy hunting would result in a substantial loss of income to the hunting organisations. Moving bear hunting and compensation mechanisms from local management and responsibility to a more centralised system without trophy hunting, as suggested by EU legislation, will lead to considerable uncertainties. These include how to make centralised decisions on population targets and offtake levels for population control, given the uncertainty around population estimates, and on compensation payments given the loss of the current system which relies heavily on local income from trophy hunting, local relationships and informal monetary and non-monetary compensation.},

	abstract = {Top-down processes, via the direct and indirect effects of interspecific competitive killing (no consumption of the kill) or intraguild predation (consumption of the kill), can potentially influence the spatial distribution of terrestrial predators, but few studies have demonstrated the phenomenon at a continental scale. For example, in North America, grey wolves Canis lupus are known to kill coyotes Canis latrans, and coyotes, in turn, may kill foxes Vulpes spp., but the spatial effects of these competitive interactions at large scales are unknown. Here, we analyse fur return data across eight jurisdictions in North America to test whether the presence or absence of wolves has caused a continent-wide shift in coyote and red fox Vulpes vulpes density. Our results support the existence of a continental scale cascade whereby coyotes outnumber red foxes in areas where wolves have been extirpated by humans, whereas red foxes outnumber coyotes in areas where wolves are present. However, for a distance of up to 200 km on the edge of wolf distribution, there is a transition zone where the effects of top-down control are weakened, possibly due to the rapid dispersal and reinvasion capabilities of coyotes into areas where wolves are sporadically distributed or at low densities. Our results have implications for understanding how the restoration of wolf populations across North America could potentially affect co-occurring predators and prey. We conclude that large carnivores may need to occupy large continuous areas to facilitate among-carnivore cascades and that studies of small areas may not be indicative of the effects of top-down mesopredator control.},

Previously, models have been developed primarily for fixed trap arrays which define the observable locations of individuals by a set of discrete points. 2.GÈHere, we develop a class of models for Gˇsearch-encounterG data, i.e. for detections of recognizable individuals in continuous space, not restricted to trap locations. In our hierarchical model, detection probability is related to the average distance between individual location and the survey path. The locations are allowed to change over time owing to movements of individuals, and individual locations are related formally by a model describing individual activity or home range centre which is itself regarded as a latent variable in the model. We provide a Bayesian analysis of the model in WinBUGS, and develop a custom MCMC algorithm in the R language. 3.GÈThe model is applied to simulated data and to territory mapping data for the Willow Tit from the Swiss Breeding Bird Survey MHB. While the observed density was 15 territories per nominal 1-km2 plot of unknown effective sample area, the model produced a density estimate of 21-+12 territories per square km (95\% posterior interval: 17GÙ26). 4.GÈSpatial captureGÙrecapture models are relevant to virtually all animal population studies that seek to estimate population size or density, yet existing models have been proposed mainly for conventional sampling using arrays of traps. Our model for search-encounter data, where the spatial pattern of searching can be arbitrary and may change over occasions, greatly expands the scope and utility of spatial captureGÙrecapture models.},

	abstract = {Intertidal seagrasses show high variability in their extent and location, with local extinctions and (re-)colonizations being inherent in their population dynamics. Suitable habitats are identified usually using Species Distribution Models (SDM), based upon the overall distribution of the species; thus, accounting solely for spatial variability. To include temporal effects caused by large interannual variability, we constructed SDMs for different combinations and fusions of yearly distribution data. The main objectives were to: (i) assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of an intertidal seagrass bed of Zostera marina; (ii) select the most accurate SDM techniques to model different temporal distribution data subsets of the species; (iii) assess the relative importance of the environmental variables for each data subset; and (iv) evaluate the accuracy of the models to predict species conservation areas, addressing implications for management. To address these objectives, a time series of 14-year distribution data of Zostera marina in the Ems estuary (The Netherlands) was used to build different data subsets: (1) total presence area; (2) a conservative estimate of the total presence area, defined as the area which had been occupied during at least 4. years; (3) core area, defined as the area which had been occupied during at least 2/3 of the total period; and (4-6) three random selections of monitoring years. On average, colonized and disappeared areas of the species in the Ems estuary showed remarkably similar transition probabilities of 12.7\% and 12.9\%, respectively. SDMs based upon machine-learning methods (Boosted Regression Trees and Random Forest) outperformed regression-based methods. Current velocity and wave exposure were the most important variables predicting the species presence for widely distributed data. Depth and sea floor slope were relevant to predict conservative presence area and core area. It is concluded that, the fusion of the spatial distribution data from four monitoring years could be enough to establish an accurate habitat suitability model of Zostera marina in the Ems estuary. The methodology presented offers a promising tool for selecting realistic conservation areas for those species that show high population dynamics, such as many estuarine and coastal species. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Vital baseline information on population status of large carnivores is still deficient in most forests of eastern Himalaya, which are known to be the biodiversity hotspots. To fill this information gap, we estimated the large carnivore population status and abundance in an intricate eastern Himalayan lowland tropical forest in Pakke Tiger Reserve, Arunachal Pradesh. Population status and abundance estimates of tigers and leopards were made through individual identification using closed capture-recapture sampling. To estimate the dhole abundance photographic encounter rate was used. For individually non-identifiable species photographic rate seemed to correlate well with animal abundance. The estimated tiger and leopard density through 1/2 MMDM was 2.14±0.04/100km2 and 2.99±1.13/100km2 respectively. Maximum likelihood estimates shows density of tiger 1.86±0.7 and for leopard 2.82±1.2.The estimated dhole abundance was (N) 10.6±0.94, and density 6.62±0.58 individuals in 100km2.

	abstract = {Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) is being increasingly applied in wildlife monitoring and population genetic research. This study was designed to evaluate the use of NGS for reconstructing the spatial structure of populations of large felids. We developed a procedure for reliably genotyping individuals of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from samples obtained through a hair-trapping scheme based on a network of lynx scent-marking sites. The spatial locations of the identified genotypes were matched with the home ranges distribution of radio-tracked individuals, thus cross-checking the accuracy of the two methods. We analyzed DNA extracted from 170 hair samples and 11 blood samples from live-trapped lynx collected in 2004-2009 in the Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland. We obtained PCR products in 96 (67\%) hair samples; 82 (85\%) of them were reliably genotyped at 12 autosomal microsatellite loci following a multiple-tubes protocol and stringent quality-controls of the data set. The sample included 29 distinct genotypes; 18 were found only in hair samples, five were determined only in live-trapped animals, and six in both hair and blood samples. Based on linkage disequilibrium we estimated an effective population size Ne=20.3 (90\% CI=15-28). The total population size estimated with Capwire was Nc=32 (95\% CI=25-37) in close agreement with the observed number of genotypes. The genotypes obtained from hair samples were re-sampled on average 3.9 times and 50\% of them were recorded for more than one year. The spatial distribution of six hair-genotypes was consistent with their home ranges obtained by radio-tracking in the same period. The distribution ranges of hair-trapped genotypes overlapped on average in 86.4\% (mode 100\%) with home ranges of the corresponding individuals. Hair-trapping and molecular identification is a reliable method for reconstructing the spatial organization of lynx population. It is likely to be also efficiently used in other rare and endangered species of felids in combination with data from other monitoring techniques, such as radio- and snow-tracking and photo-trapping. © 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

	abstract = {Population density is a critical ecological parameter informing effective wildlife management and conservation decisions. Density is often estimated by dividing capture–recapture (C–R) estimates of abundance (N{\textasciicircum}) by size of the study area, but this relies on the assumption of geographic closure – a situation rarely achieved in studies of large carnivores. For geographically open populations N{\textasciicircum} is overestimated relative to the size of the study area because animals with only part of their home range on the study area are available for capture. This bias (‘edge effect’) is more severe when animals such as large carnivores range widely. To compensate for edge effect, a boundary strip around the trap array is commonly included when estimating the effective trap area (A{\textasciicircum}). Various methods for estimating the width of the boundary strip are proposed, but N{\textasciicircum} ⁄ A{\textasciicircum} estimates of large carnivore density are generally mistrusted unless concurrent telemetry data are available to defineA{\textasciicircum}. Remote sampling by cameras or hair snags may reduce study costs and duration, yet without telem- etry data inflated density estimates remain problematic. 2. We evaluated recently developed spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models using data from a common large carnivore, the American black bear Ursus americanus, obtained by remote sampling of 11 geographically open populations. These models permit direct estimation of population density from C–R data without assuming geographic closure. We compared estimates derived using this approach to those derived using conventional approaches that estimate density as N{\textasciicircum} ⁄ A{\textasciicircum}. 3.

Programs that collect count data are often prohibitively expensive and time intensive, limiting the number of species that can be simultaneously monitored. Presence data, on the other hand, can often be collected in less time and for multiple species simultaneously. We investigate the relationship of counts to presence using 49 butterfly species across 4 sites over 9 years, and then compare trends produced from each index. We also employed simulated datasets to test the effect of reduced sampling on the relationship of counts to presence data and to investigate changes in each index’s power to reveal population trends. Presence and counts were highly correlated for most species tested, and population trends based on each index were concordant for most species. The effect of reduced sampling was species-specific, but on a whole, sensitivity of both indices to detect population trends was reduced. Common and rare species, as well as those with a range of life-history and behavioral traits performed equally well. The relationship between presence and count data may break down in cases of very abundant and widespread species with extended flight seasons. Our results suggest that when used cautiously, presence data has the potential to be used as a surrogate for counts. Collection of presence data may be useful for multi-species monitoring or to reduce the duration of monitoring visits without fully sacrificing the ability to infer population trends.},

Motion sensitive camera traps offer a visual sensor to record the presence of a broad range of species pro- viding location specific information on movement and behavior. Modern digital camera traps that record video present new analytical opportunities, but also new data management challenges. This paper describes our experience with a terrestrial animal monitoring system at Barro Colorado Is- land, Panama. Our camera network captured the spatio-temporal dynamics of terrestrial bird and mammal activity at the site - data relevant to immediate science questions, and long-term con- servation issues. We believe that the experience gained and lessons learned during our year long deployment and testing of the camera traps as well as the developed solutions are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for the advancement of the sensor network research. We suggest that the continued development of these hardware, software, and analytical tools, in concert, offer an exciting sensor-network solution to monitoring of animal populations which could realistically scale over larger areas and time spans.},

The method is used to estimate the population density of 10 species of breeding birds sampled by mist–netting in deciduous forest at Patuxent Research Refuge, Laurel, Maryland, U.S.A., from 1961 to 1972. Total density (9.9 ± 0.6 ha–1 mean ± SE) appeared to decline over time (slope –0.41 ± 0.15 ha–1y–1). The mean precision of annual estimates for all 10 species pooled was acceptable ( = 14\%). Spatial analysis of closed–population capture– recapture data highlighted deficiencies in non–spatial methodologies. For example, effective trapping area cannot be assumed constant when detection probability is variable. Simulation may be used to evaluate alternative designs for mist net arrays where density estimation is a study goal.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM) are tools used to determine environmental features that influence the geographic distribution of species' abundance and have been used to analyze presence-only records. Analysis of presence-only records may require correction for nondetection sampling bias to yield reliable conclusions. In addition, individuals of some species of animals may be highly aggregated and standard SDMs ignore environmental features that may influence aggregation behavior.We contend that nondetection sampling bias can be treated as missing data. Statistical theory and corrective methods are well developed for missing data, but have been ignored in the literature on SDMs. We developed a marked inhomogeneous Poisson point process model that accounted for nondetection and aggregation behavior in animals and tested our methods on simulated data.Correcting for nondetection sampling bias requires estimates of the probability of detection which must be obtained from auxiliary data, as presence-only data do not contain information about the detection mechanism. Weighted likelihood methods can be used to correct for nondetection if estimates of the probability of detection are available. We used an inhomogeneous Poisson point process model to model group abundance, a zero-truncated generalized linear model to model group size, and combined these two models to describe the distribution of abundance. Our methods performed well on simulated data when nondetection was accounted for and poorly when detection was ignored.We recommend researchers consider the effects of nondetection sampling bias when modeling species distributions using presence-only data. If information about the detection process is available, we recommend researchers explore the effects of nondetection and, when warranted, correct the bias using our methods. We developed our methods to analyze opportunistic presence-only records of whooping cranes (Grus americana), but expect that our methods will be useful to ecologists analyzing opportunistic presence-only records of other species of animals.},

In this study, we demonstrate the use of information criterion approaches to setting regularization in Maxent, and we compare models selected using information criteria to models selected using other criteria that are common in the literature. We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known “true” initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods. We also demonstrate that information criteria may offer significant advantages over the methods commonly used in the literature.},

	abstract = {The abundance of low-density species like carnivores is logistically difficult to directly estimate at a meaningful scale. Predictive distribution models are often used as a surrogate for density estimation. But because density can continue to increase as occupancy asymptotes at 1, occupancy may have little value as an index, and home range expansion in marginal habitat may further confound the association. We sought to estimate bobcat population size at a landscape scale (14,286km2) in central Wisconsin, which provided an opportunity to relate predicted occurrence to individual space use and population density. We sampled bobcats using motion-sensitive trail cameras at 9 arrays across central Wisconsin. We estimated bobcat site- specific occupancy, and regressed these estimates as linear or asymptotic functions of site-specific density to determine the strength and shape of their association. We subsequently modeled both parameters relative to habitat covariates and repeated the regression process. A linear functional relationship between density and occupancy was most supported when detection parameters were held constant (wi¼0.97, R2¼0.72) and when detection, occurrence, and density were modeled as a function of habitat covariates (wi¼0.99, R2¼0.95). This suggests that repeated presence-absence data alone may be an efficient and reliable method for inferring spatial patterns in bobcat density or identifying habitat types with greater density potential in the northern parts of its range. Bobcat occupancy and density were both positively associated with surrounding woody cover and wetland edge density. Our most supported spatially explicit capture-recapture model estimated bobcat abundance as 362 adult individuals (95\% CI 272–490) across the study area. ? 2015 The Wildlife Society},

	abstract = {Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models represent a major advance over traditional capture-recapture (CR) models because they yield explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an unknown area. Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal activity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby allowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked populations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10\% in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95\% CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha. Our paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions in ecology by demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is needed to estimate population density - rather, spatial dependence can be informative about individual distribution and density.},

	abstract = {Animal movement and dispersal can be described as a correlated random walk dependent on three parameters: number of steps, step size, and distribution of random turning angles. Equations of Kareiva and Shigesada use the parameters to predict the mean square displacement distance (MSDD), but this is less meaningful than the mean dispersal distance (MDD) about which the population would be distributed. I found that the MDD can be estimated by multiplying the square root of the MSDD by a three-dimensional surface correction factor obtained from simulations. The correction factors ranged from 0.89 to 1 depending on the number of steps and the variation in random turns, expressed as the standard deviation of the turning angles (SDA) about 0? (straight ahead). Corrected equations were used to predict MDDs for bark beetles, butterflies, ants, and beetles (based on parameters from the literature) and the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser). Another equation from the literature finds the MDD directly, and this agreed with the MDD obtained by simulation at some combinations of SDA and numbers of steps. However, the equation has an error that increases as a power function when the standard deviation of turning angles becomes smaller (e.g., ?6? at 1000 steps or ?13? at 250 steps). Lower numbers of steps also increase the error. Equivalent values of AMT (angle of maximum turn) in uniform random models and of SDA in normal random models were found that allowed these two models to yield similar MDD values. The step size and turning angle variation of animal paths during dispersal and host and mate searching were investigated and found to be correlated; thus, use of different measured step sizes gives consistent estimates of the MDD.

	abstract = {The arrival of a novel predator in an ecosystem necessitates many wildlife-management decisions that should be based on sound demographic data. Canis latrans (Coyote) has experienced a dramatic range expansion across North America since the early 19th century, completing its colonization of the continental US in the mid-Atlantic region over the past 20 years. Their arrival in the suburbs of Washington, DC, has generated much public attention, and demonstrated a need for demographic information about this species. To address the challenges of surveying an elusive animal, we used fecal DNA to describe the population genetics and demographics of a newly colonized Coyote population at Marine Corps Base Quantico (MCBQ) in northern Virginia. We collected 331 scats over a period of 2 years at MCBQ, resulting in identification of 23 unique individual Coyotes and 41 total Coyote captures that were analyzed using spatial capture—recapture models. We found evidence of colonization by multiple genetic lineages and a low population density of 0.047 individuals/km2. Importantly, this study incorporates a new class of models on individual animals identified by genotype data derived from fecal DNA and demonstrates the utility of these models in surveying elusive animals.},

	abstract = {* Habitats have substantial influence on the distribution and abundance of animals. Animals’ selective movement yields their habitat use. Animals generally are more abundant in habitats that are selected most strongly. * Models of habitat selection can be used to distribute animals on the landscape or their distribution can be modelled based on data of habitat use, occupancy, intensity of use or counts of animals. When the population is at carrying capacity or in an ideal-free distribution, habitat selection and related metrics of habitat use can be used to estimate abundance. * If the population is not at equilibrium, models have the flexibility to incorporate density into models of habitat selection; but abundance might be influenced by factors influencing fitness that are not directly related to habitat thereby compromising the use of habitat-based models for predicting population size. * Scale and domain of the sampling frame, both in time and space, are crucial considerations limiting application of these models. Ultimately, identifying reliable models for predicting abundance from habitat data requires an understanding of the mechanisms underlying population regulation and limitation.},

	abstract = {Understanding animal movement provides information that helps design effective conservation initiatives. We intuitively understand that the way animals move at large scales determines the extent of their home range and their migratory patterns – and we know that these features are relevant to decisions about the location, size and distribution of protected areas. It is less intuitively obvious that knowledge of movement characteristics at finer scales can also have conservation implications. By modelling the small to intermediate scale movement (1–103m) of a large marine predator in a shallow coastal environment, we show how different assumptions about movement patterns influence estimates of species abundance derived from field observations. Foraging behaviour, statistical properties of the swimming path and average speed exert the greatest impact, suggesting that these should be the focus of further experimental work. Better data would inform our understanding and considerably reduce the uncertainty in abundance estimation, improving conservation-related decision making.},

We quantified bias in brown bear (Ursus arctos) abundance estimates introduced when analytical methods ignore that the same individuals may be accounted for in more than one jurisdiction. A spatially explicit population model revealed that up to 49\% of female bears detected in Norway via microsatellite analysis of scat and hair samples have their center of activity in neighboring countries (Finland, Russia, and Sweden). Not accounting for detections of “foreign residents” resulted in abundance estimates that were inflated by as much as 119\%. Like man- agement and conservation, monitoring of transboundary wildlife populations should take place at ecologically relevant scales to avoid biased abundance es- timates and a false sense of control.When political realities isolate jurisdictions from their neighbors, spatially explicit analytical approaches can allow local or national programs a glimpse beyond their borders.},

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

Hence the choice of an appropriate method to estimate abundance is critical. Deer are not native to Australia and are a declared pest in some states where their numbers must be controlled in environmentally sensitive areas. The aim of this research was to help Australian land managers choose between widely used methods to count deer. We compared population estimates or indices from: distance sampling, aerial surveys, spotlight counts, and faecal pellet counts. For each we estimated the labour input, cost, and precision. The coefficient of variation varied with method and time of year from 8.7 to 36.6\%. Total labour input per sampling event varied from 11 to 136 h. Total costs of vehicles and equipment per sampling event varied from AU\$913 to \$2966. Overall, the spotlight method performed the best at our study site when comparing labour input, total cost and precision. However, choice of the most precise, cost effective method will be site specific and rely on information collected from a pilot study, We provide recommendations to help land managers choose between possible methods in various circumstances.},

Questionnaires were administered before and after the 4-week IELT assessments.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IELT; erectile function dysfunction score of International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: The IELT had a positively skewed distribution, with a geometric mean of 5.7 minutes and a median of 6.0 minutes (range: 0.1-52.1 minutes). Men from Turkey had the shortest median IELT (4.4 minutes). Men from the United Kingdom had the longest IELT (10.0 minutes). Circumcision and condom use had no significant impact on the median IELT. Subjects who were discontent with their latency time had slightly lower median IELT values of 5.2 minutes than the median of the population.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: The IELT distribution, measured with a blinded timer device, is very similar to the IELT distribution of our previous population survey which utilized a stopwatch.

We next present an overview of GLMs and GAMs, and discuss some of their related statistics used for predictor selection, model diagnostics, and evaluation. Included is a discussion of several new approaches applicable to GLMs and GAMs, such as ridge regression, an alternative to stepwise selection of predictors, and methods for the identification of interactions by a combined use of regression trees and several other approaches.

SPECIES couples an artificial neural network with a climate-hydrological process model. The hybrid model has been successfully trained to estimate current species distributions using climate and soils data at the European scale before application at a finer resolution national scale. Using this multi-scale approach ensures encapsulation of the full extent of future climate scenarios within Great Britain without extrapolating outside of the model's training dataset. Application of the model to 32 plant species produced a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.841 and a mean Kappa statistic of 0.772 between observed and simulated distributions. Simulations of four climate change scenarios revealed that changes to suitable climate space in Great Britain is highly species dependent and that distribution changes may be multidirectional and temporally non-linear. Analysis of the SPECIES results suggests that the neural network methodology can provide a feasible alternative to more classical spatial statistical techniques. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the case of eBird, a major cause of poor quality data is the misidentification of bird species by inexperienced contributors. A proactive approach for improving data quality is to discover commonly misidentified bird species and to teach inexperienced birders the differences between these species. To accomplish this goal, we develop a latent variable graphical model that can identify groups of bird species that are often confused for each other by eBird participants. Our model is a multi-species extension of the classic occupancy-detection model in the ecology literature. This multi-species extension requires a structure learning step as well as a computationally expensive parameter learning stage which we make efficient through a variational approximation. We show that our model can not only discover groups of misidentified species, but by including these misidentifications in the model, it can also achieve more accurate predictions of both species occupancy and detection.},

We assessed the effects of wolf mortality on reducing livestock depredations in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming from 1987-2012 using a 25 year time series. The number of livestock depredated, livestock populations, wolf population estimates, number of breeding pairs, and wolves killed were calculated for the wolf-occupied area of each state for each year. The data were then analyzed using a negative binomial generalized linear model to test for the expected negative relationship between the number of livestock depredated in the current year and the number of wolves controlled the previous year. We found that the number of livestock depredated was positively associated with the number of livestock and the number of breeding pairs. However, we also found that the number of livestock depredated the following year was positively, not negatively, associated with the number of wolves killed the previous year. The odds of livestock depredations increased 4\% for sheep and 5-6\% for cattle with increased wolf control--up until wolf mortality exceeded the mean intrinsic growth rate of wolves at 25\%. Possible reasons for the increased livestock depredations at ≤25\% mortality may be compensatory increased breeding pairs and numbers of wolves following increased mortality. After mortality exceeded 25\%, the total number of breeding pairs, wolves, and livestock depredations declined. However, mortality rates exceeding 25\% are unsustainable over the long term. Lethal control of individual depredating wolves may sometimes necessary to stop depredations in the near-term, but we recommend that non-lethal alternatives also be considered.},

For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

While it has rarely been assessed how likely it is to detect effects given a specific sample size, it was never analysed how reliable results are if the test preconditions, particularly of parametric tests, are not fulfilled or how likely it is to detect deviations from these preconditions. Therefore, we analyse the performance of a parametric and a non-parametric test using Monte Carlo simulation, focussing on typical data used in ecotoxicological risk assessments. We show that none of the data distributions are normal and that for typical sample sizes of N{\textless}20 it is very unlikely to detect deviations from normality. Non-parametric tests performed markedly better than parametric tests, except when data were in fact normally distributed. We finally discuss the impact of using different tests on pesticide risk assessments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the drivers of habitat selection by insect disease vectors is instrumental to the design and operation of rational control-surveillance systems. One pervasive yet often overlooked drawback of vector studies is that detection failures result in some sites being misclassified as uninfested; naïve infestation indices are therefore biased, and this can confound our view of vector habitat preferences. Here, we present an initial attempt at applying methods that explicitly account for imperfect detection to investigate the ecology of Chagas disease vectors in man-made environments.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODOLOGY: We combined triplicate-sampling of individual ecotopes (n = 203) and site-occupancy models (SOMs) to test a suite of pre-specified hypotheses about habitat selection by Triatoma brasiliensis. SOM results were compared with those of standard generalized linear models (GLMs) that assume perfect detection even with single bug-searches.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Triatoma brasiliensis was strongly associated with key hosts (native rodents, goats/sheep and, to a lesser extent, fowl) in peridomestic environments; ecotope structure had, in comparison, small to negligible effects, although wooden ecotopes were slightly preferred. We found evidence of dwelling-level aggregation of infestation foci; when there was one such focus, same-dwelling ecotopes, whether houses or peridomestic structures, were more likely to become infested too. GLMs yielded negatively-biased covariate effect estimates and standard errors; both were, on average, about four times smaller than those derived from SOMs.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results confirm substantial population-level ecological heterogeneity in T. brasiliensis. They also suggest that, at least in some sites, control of this species may benefit from peridomestic rodent control and changes in goat/sheep husbandry practices. Finally, our comparative analyses highlight the importance of accounting for the various sources of uncertainty inherent to vector studies, including imperfect detection. We anticipate that future research on infectious disease ecology will increasingly rely on approaches akin to those described here.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection of offspring resulting from hybridization between individuals of distinct populations has a range of applications in conservation and population genetics. We assessed the hybrid identification efficiency of two methods (implemented in the STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS programs) which are tailored to identifying hybrid individuals but use different approaches. Simulated first- and second-generation hybrids were used to assess the performance of these two methods in detecting recent hybridization under scenarios with different levels of genetic divergence and varying numbers of loci. Despite the different approaches of the methods, the hybrid detection efficiency was generally similar and neither of the two methods outperformed the other in all scenarios assessed. Interestingly, hybrid detection efficiency was only minimally affected by whether reference population allele frequency information was included or not. In terms of genotyping effort, efficient detection of F1 hybrid individuals requires the use of 12 or 24 loci with pairwise F(ST) between hybridizing parental populations of 0.21 or 0.12, respectively. While achievable, these locus numbers are nevertheless higher than the number of loci currently commonly applied in population genetic studies. The method of STRUCTURE seemed to be less sensitive to the proportion of hybrids included in the sample, while NEWHYBRIDS seemed to perform slightly better when individuals from both backcross and F1 hybrid classes were present in the sample. However, separating backcrosses from purebred parental individuals requires a considerable genotyping effort (at least 48 loci), even when divergence between parental populations is high.},

	abstract = {Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of hidden Markov models (HMMs) involves latent states underlying an imperfect observation process, and generates posterior samples for top-level parameters concurrently with nuisance latent variables. When potentially many HMMs are embedded within a hierarchical model, this can result in prohibitively long MCMC runtimes. We study combinations of existing methods, which are shown to vastly improve computational efficiency for these hierarchical models while maintaining the modeling flexibility provided by embedded HMMs. The methods include discrete filtering of the HMM likelihood to remove latent states, reduced data representations, and a novel procedure for dynamic block sampling of posterior dimensions. The first two methods have been used in isolation in existing application-specific software, but are not generally available for incorporation in arbitrary model structures. Using the NIMBLE package for R, we develop and test combined computational approaches using three examples from ecological capture-recapture, although our methods are generally applicable to any embedded discrete HMMs. These combinations provide several orders of magnitude improvement in MCMC sampling efficiency, defined as the rate of generating effectively independent posterior samples. In addition to being computationally significant for this class of hierarchical models, this result underscores the potential for vast improvements to MCMC sampling efficiency which can result from combinations of known algorithms.},

Specifically, the tests are robust when used with data collected from utilization distributions that are not normal, but they are sensitive to nonstationary distributionsi nduced by shifts in centers of activity or variance-covariance structure.W e also used simulations to examine how negative bias in kernel and polygon estimators of home-range size is influenced by level of autocorrelation, sampling rate, sampling de-sign, and study duration. Relative bias increased with increasing levels of autocorrelation and reduced sample sizes. Kernel (95\%) estimates were less biased than minimum convex polygon estimates. The effect of autocorrelationi s greatest when low levels of bias ({\textgreater} -5\%) are desired. For percent relative bias in the range of -20\% to -5\%, though, collection of moderatelya utocorrelatedd ata bears little cost in terms of additionall oss of spatial information relative to an equal number of independent observations. Tests of independence, when used with stationary data, provide a useful measure of the rate of home-range use and a means of checking assumptions associated with analyses of habitat use. However, our results indicate that exclusive use of independent observations is unnecessary when estimating home-range size with kernel or polygon methods.},

	abstract = {Camera traps have proven very useful in ecological, conservation and behavioral research. Camera traps non-invasively record presence and behavior of animals in their natural environment. Since the introduction of digital cameras, large amounts of data can be stored. Unfortunately, processing protocols did not evolve as fast as the technical capabilities of the cameras. We used camera traps to record videos of Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber). However, a large number of recordings did not contain the target species, but instead empty recordings or other species (together non-target recordings), making the removal of these recordings unacceptably time consuming. In this paper we propose a method to partially eliminate non-target recordings without having to watch the recordings, in order to reduce workload. Discrimination between recordings of target species and non-target recordings was based on detecting variation (changes in pixel values from frame to frame) in the recordings. Because of the size of the target species, we supposed that recordings with the target species contain on average much more movements than non-target recordings. Two different filter methods were tested and compared. We show that a partial discrimination can be made between target and non-target recordings based on variation in pixel values and that environmental conditions and filter methods influence the amount of non-target recordings that can be identified and discarded. By allowing a loss of 5\% to 20\% of recordings containing the target species, in ideal circumstances, 53\% to 76\% of non-target recordings can be identified and discarded. We conclude that adding an extra processing step in the camera trap protocol can result in large time savings. Since we are convinced that the use of camera traps will become increasingly important in the future, this filter method can benefit many researchers, using it in different contexts across the globe, on both videos and photographs.},

Most Amur tigers are found in Russia, where their range is fragmented into at least 3 populations (a large population centered in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains and 2 smaller populations in northwest and southwest Primorye Krai). Traditionally, track-based techniques have been used for surveys of tigers in Russia. However, such techniques involve problems such as misinterpretation of track sizes due to snow degradation, and thus, other survey protocols have been needed. This study aimed to identify individuals and estimate population size using noninvasive genetic samples, such as feces, hairs, and saliva, collected from southwest Primorye Krai during 4 winters (2000-2001, 2001-2002,2002-2003, and 2004-2005). During these winters, we identified 12 tigers (5 males and 7 females) using 10 microsatellite markers. Population size estimated from the 2002-2003 samples was 12 (95\% confidence interval = 9-19), which was comparable to the estimate from the track count survey. Of the 3 types of noninvasive genetic samples we collected, feces were the most useful in terms of genotyping success rate and sampling efficiency. The noninvasive genetic methods developed in this study can contribute to population monitoring and management assessment of tiger conservation in the Russian Far East.},

Still, for many harvested populations, hunting statistics are the only available data source and cautious use of such data may be valuable for management. Here we assessed to what extent long-term monitoring of Svalbard rock ptarmigan spring densities and hunting statistics (bag size and proportion of juveniles in the hunting bag) reflect similar population fluctuations. We found a decreasing trend in both bag size and proportion of juveniles in the bag, but no trend in ptarmigan spring densities. However, annual fluctuations of ptarmigan spring density and bag size were correlated. Together, these time series indicate that both population abundance (bag size) and recruitment (proportion of juveniles in the bag) are decreasing, but the reproductive component fraction (density of territorial males) is not yet compromised. This biological interpretation remains, however, uncertain due to lack of hunting effort data. Monitoring programs using hunting statistics should therefore critically discuss and evaluate what the hunting statistics reflect and fine-tune the hunter data collection to obtain maximum biological relevance. Still, our results illustrate that the combination of population estimates and hunting statistics can provide more nuanced information about the population status than the density estimates alone.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores are difficult to monitor because they tend to be sparsely distributed, sensitive to human activity, and associated with complex life histories. Consequently, understanding population trend and viability requires conservationists to cope with uncertainty and bias in population data. Joint analysis of combined data sets using multiple models (i.e., integrated population model) can improve inference about mechanisms (e.g., habitat heterogeneity and food distribution) affecting population dynamics. However, unobserved or unobservable processes can also introduce bias and can be difficult to quantify. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach for inference on an integrated population model that reconciles annual population counts with recruitment and survival data (i.e., demographic processes). Our modeling framework is flexible and enables a realistic form of population dynamics by fitting separate density-dependent responses for each demographic process. Discrepancies estimated from shared parameters among different model components represent unobserved additions (i.e., recruitment or immigration) or removals (i.e., death or emigration) when annual population counts are reliable. In a case study of gray wolves in Wisconsin (1980-2011), concordant with policy changes, we estimated that a discrepancy of 0\% (1980-1995), -2\% (1996-2002), and 4\% (2003-2011) in the annual mortality rate was needed to explain annual growth rate. Additional mortality in 2003-2011 may reflect density-dependent mechanisms, changes in illegal killing with shifts in wolf management, and nonindependent censoring in survival data. Integrated population models provide insights into unobserved or unobservable processes by quantifying discrepancies among data sets. Our modeling approach is generalizable to many population analysis needs and allows for identifying dynamic differences due to external drivers, such as management or policy changes.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations in climate, sea level and sedimentation rates, in addition to the neotectonic activity, during the geological evolution of the Tigris-Euphrates delta (in the last 10,000 years) had resulted in the deposition of various sedimentary units. Previously, five main stratigraphic units, with other sub-units, have been identified by the author during the study of the Holocene deltaic successions of Lower Mesopotamia and as based upon the results of petrological, geochemical, palaeontological and radiometric analyses of his PhD dissertation. Each unit has been produced through various depositional and diagenetic processes in addition to the dominant climate. Such processes together have been clearly recorded in the forms of either the authigenic minerals occurring in each sequence, particularly the Ca-Mg carbonates, evaporites and clay minerals, the biological activities represented by shell remains of molluscs, foraminifers and ostracods, or the preservation of organic matters within organic-rich layers. This review discusses the impact climatic changes had on the accumulated sedimentary facies during the Holocene evolution of the Tigris-Euphrates delta. Arid climate dominated the study area in the early Holocene after a long period of the wetter conditions of Pleistocene. Such a climatic change has resulted in the formation of gypcretes rich in palygorskite and dolomite occurring within the calcareous fluvial-plain muds, similar to the modern fluvial plain deposits. However, the sediments were highly admixed with coarser sandy deposits of playa and aeolian sources in the western desertic margins, and with older reworked sands of Zagros foothills to the Northeast of Lower Mesopotamia. During the mid-Holocene marine invasion, when the climate became wetter as well, brackish-water/marine sedimentary sub-units were deposited, overlying the previous fluvial plain deposits. The deposition started with a transitional sub-unit flourishing over the older early Holocene gypcrete deposits signaling the marine transgression. The best preservation of organic matters occurred beneath this sub-unit. This sub-unit, which is also characterised by microcrystalline mixing zone dolomite, was followed by the deposition of another sub-unit rich in molluscs and foraminifera that collected during the transgressive period. After about 2000 years of maximum flooding (i.e. high stand period), a regressive tidal flat unit was deposited ending the marine/brackish-water deposition and signaling another climatic change towards a more add setting around 4000 years ago. These climatic conditions are still continuous in the area and reflect the petrology of the modern salt-covered fluvial plain deposits of these rivers. However, marsh/lacustrine deposits and environments remained, covering some vast lowland parts of the fluvial plains, but further inland to the north of the present-day northern Gulf coasts. Complex implications of neotectonic activities, sea-level fluctuations and differential sedimentation rates in addition to the climatic changes during Holocene have resulted in the formation and preservation of these unique marshlands, which are still covering most parts of the ancient Tigris-Euphrates-Karun delta. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {The spatial grazing patterns of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in a subalpine grassland ecosystem of the Swiss National Park were analysed with reference to the phosphorus content in the topsoil and to the former agricultural management system. Changes in the composition of the vegetation and in plant species richness were studied on permanent plots set up between 1917 and 1945 in areas which today are heavily grazed by red deer, and were related to the development of the red deer population. The spatial grazing patterns of red deer are, 80 years after the Park's foundation, still determined by former agricultural use. Red deer prefer the most phosphorus-rich, formerly irrigated parts for grazing. Grazing by red deer was found to be the driving force behind temporal changes in the vegetation observed on the subalpine grasslands. Plant succession has proceeded faster in the preferred grazing areas and the vegetation has adapted to the grazing pressure with a decrease in tall-growing plant species. At the same time, the abundance of unpalatable species has increased due to (i) morphological defences, (ii) spatial avoidance, i.e. by growing close to the ground and (iii) temporal avoidance because they have a short life-span (annuals). Changes in vegetation composition have coincided with a sharp increase in species richness. Between 1917 and 1999, the number of plant species has doubled on average. We found a highly significant correlation between the changes in the numbers of plant species and red deer, with species richness increasing with increasing deer density. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Yearling mass decreased in both populations over the study period, but much of this decline seemed to originate from a sharp drop in 2003, after which body mass remained low. Our analysis suggested that this decrease was caused by the additive effects of warm springs and summers over the first 2 years of life. The mass of adult chamois also decreased over time. These results suggest that ongoing warming in the Alps could be a selective pressure on the life history and reproductive strategies of wild ungulates.},

It’s one of those books that spans multiple disciplines so is both unique and also niche. In essence it’s a manifesto of sorts on using functional programming for mathematical modeling and analysis, which is based on my R package lambda.r. It spans the lambda calculus, traditional mathematical analysis, and set theory to 1) develop a mathematical model for the R language, and 2) show how to use this formalism to prove the equivalence of programs to their underlying model. I try to keep the book focused on applications, so I discuss financial trading systems, some NLP/document classification, and also web analytics. The book started off as a more practical affair, but one thing that I’ve learned through this process is how to push ideas to the limit. So now it delves into quite a bit of theory, which makes it a more compelling read. In some ways it reminds me of ice climbing, where you’re scaling a waterfall and really pushing yourself in ways you didn’t think possible. Three chapters into the process, and it’s been that same combination of exhilarating challenge that results in conflicting thoughts racing through your head: “Holy crap — what am I doing?!” versus “This is so fun — wheeeee!” versus “I can’t believe I did it!” That said, this book pushes some new territory. Many of the ideas are experimental and provisional. The proofs probably could use some work. So in the spirit of openness I’m looking to share my thoughts and get feedback from the general community on the ideas within the pages. Issues I already know about include: Images need to be cleaned up. Some are in color, others need to be scaled Some proofs are incomplete. Their absence shouldn’t impact the content Some examples need to be completed. Again, it shouldn’t impact the overall reading of the material.},

The use of camera traps to estimate animal density has so far been restricted to capture–recapture analysis of species with individually identifiable markings. This study developed a method that eliminates the requirement for individual recognition of animals by modelling the underlying process of contact between animals and cameras. 2. The model provides a factor that linearly scales trapping rate with density, depending on two key biological variables (average animal group size and day range) and two characteristics of the camera sensor (distance and angle within which it detects animals). 3. We tested the approach in an enclosed animal park with known abundances of four species, obtaining accurate estimates in three out of four cases. Inaccuracy in the fourth species was because of biased placement of cameras with respect to the distribution of this species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to unbiased camera placement and accurate measurement of model parameters, this method opens the possibility of reduced labour costs for estimating wildlife density and may make estimation possible where it has not been previously. We provide guidelines on the trapping effort required to obtain reasonably precise estimates.},

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is a well-recognized concern for observational data in general, and more specifically for spatial data in ecology. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with spatially autocorrelated random effects are a potential general framework for handling these spatial correlations. However, as the result of statistical and practical issues, such GLMMs have been fitted through the undocumented use of procedures based on penalized quasi-likelihood approximations (PQL), and under restrictive models of spatial correlation. Alternatively, they are often neglected in favor of simpler but more questionable approaches. In this work we aim to provide practical and validated means of inference under spatial GLMMs, that overcome these limitations. For this purpose, a new software is developed to fit spatial GLMMs. We use it to assess the performance of likelihood ratio tests for fixed effects under spatial autocorrelation, based on Laplace or PQL approximations of the likelihood. Expectedly, the Laplace approximation performs generally slightly better, although a variant of PQL was better in the binary case. We show that a previous implementation of PQL methods in the R language, glmmPQL, is not appropriate for such applications. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of a bootstrap procedure for correcting the small sample bias of the tests, which applies also to non-spatial models.},

	abstract = {In order to effectively manage habitat for fragmented populations, we need to know details of resource utilisation, and the capacity of species to colonise unoccupied habitat patches. Dispersal is vital in maintaining viable populations in increasingly fragmented environments by allowing re-colonisation of areas in which populations have gone extinct. In the UK, the endangered aspen hoverfly Hammerschmidtia ferruginea (Fall,n 1817) (Diptera, Syrphidae) depends on a limited and transient breeding habitat: decaying aspen wood Populus tremula L. (Salicaceae). Conservation management for H. ferruginea involves encouraging aspen expansion across Scotland, and ensuring retention, maintenance and continuity of dead wood where H. ferruginea has been recorded and in areas that may link populations. In order to do this effectively we need to know how far H. ferruginea can disperse. By taking advantage of the tendency of adults to group on decaying aspen logs, we estimated dispersal ability through mark recapture techniques. In the first year, 1,066 flies were marked as they emerged from aspen logs and 78 were re-sighted at artificially-placed decaying aspen logs up to 4 km from the release site. In the second year, of 1,157 individually marked flies, 112 were re-sighted and one was observed 5 km from the release site. Territorial behaviour was recorded at all (19) decaying aspen log locations. In total, 72 males were recorded defending territories, which overlapped with 68 \% of recorded female oviposition sites. Among males only, wing length was positively associated with dispersal. While these results show H. ferruginea is capable of locating decaying logs up to 5 km away, most dispersing individuals (68 \%) were recorded at 1 km, which should be taken into account in developing management protocols. If enough dead wood is available it should be distributed within a radius of 1-2 km, and where possible, as stepping-stones linking up aspen woodlands. We discuss the implications of our findings for the natural history of this species, and make recommendations for its conservation management.},

	abstract = {1. A common sampling design in resource selection studies involves measuring resource attributes at sample units used by an animal and at sample units considered available for use. Few models can estimate the absolute probability of using a sample unit from such data, but such approaches are generally preferred over statistical methods that estimate a relative probability of use. 2. The case-control model that allows for contaminated controls, proposed by Lancaster \& Imbens (1996) and Lele (2009), can estimate the absolute probability of using a sample unit from use-availability data. However, numerous misconceptions have likely prevented the widespread application of this model to resource selection studies. We address common misconceptions regarding the case-control model with contaminated controls and demonstrate its ability to estimate the absolute probability of use, prevalence and parameters associated with categorical covariates from use-availability data. 3. We fit the case-control model with contaminated controls to simulated data with varying prevalence (defined as the average probability of use across all sample units) and sample sizes (n1 = 500 used and na = 500 available samples; n1 = 1000 used and na = 1000 available samples). We then applied this model to estimate the probability Ozark hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi) would use a location within a stream as a function of covariates. 4. The case-control model with contaminated controls provided unbiased estimates of all parameters at N = 2000 sample size simulation scenarios, particularly at low prevalence. However, this model produced increasingly variable maximum likelihood estimates of parameters as prevalence increased, particularly at N = 1000 sample size scenarios. We thus recommend at least 500-1000 used samples when fitting the case-control model with contaminated controls to use-availability data. Our application to hellbender data revealed selection for locations with coarse substrate that are close to potential sources of cover. 5. This study unites a disparate literature, addresses and clarifies many commonly held misconceptions and demonstrates that the case-control model with contaminated controls is a viable alternative for estimating the absolute probability of use from use-availability data.},

	abstract = {1. Supplementary winter feeding of game animals, and particularly deer, is a common practice throughout northern (continental) Europe and parts of North America. Feeding is normally associated with maintaining high densities of animals for hunting, in terms of: (i) maintaining or increasing body weights and condition overwinter; (ii) improving reproductive performance and fertility; (iii) increasing overwinter survival; and (iv) reducing levels of damage caused to agriculture and forestry or the natural heritage. We consider the balance of evidence on the effectiveness of winter feeding of red deerCervus elaphusin achieving these objectives. Where that evidence is equivocal, we attempt to reconcile apparent contradictions to evaluate the circumstances under which winter feeding may or may not be effective.2. In general, feeding of red deer on open range appears to have relatively little effect on body weights or fecundity. Effects on increasing antler size and quality are variable and seem to depend on the degree to which animals may be mineral limited on native range. Effects on survival are similarly ambiguous. It is apparent, however, that to be effective in reducing mortality, any supplementation is required early in the season and not simply when heavy mortalities are already being experienced. If provision of supplementary foods is delayed until animals are perceived already to be in poor condition, such feeding may have little effect.3. One of the primary goals of winter feeding in both Europe and the USA has become the prevention of environmental damage, particularly damage to commercial and native forests, while maintaining deer populations at densities suitable for hunting. Again, empirical evidence for effectiveness in this regard is inconclusive, with some studies showing a decrease in damage caused, some showing no effect and others showing a significant increase in local impact.4.

	abstract = {Estimating population size of elusive and rare species is challenging. The difficulties in catching such species has triggered the use of samples collected noninvasively, such as feces or hair, from which genetic analysis yields data similar to capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data. There are, however, two differences between classical CMR and noninvasive CMR. First, capture and recapture data are gathered over multiple sampling sessions in classical CMR, whereas in noninvasive CMR they can be obtained from a single sampling session. Second, because of genotyping errors and unlike classical CMR, there isno simple relationship between (genetic) marks and individuals in noninvasive CMR. We evaluated, through simulations, the reliability of population size estimates based on noninvasive CMR. For equal sampling efforts, we compared estimates of population size N obtained from accumulation curves, a maximum likelihood, and a Bayesian estimator. For a closed population and without sampling heterogeneity, estimates obtained from noninvasive CMRwere as reliable as estimates from classical CMR. The sampling structure (single or multiple session) did not alter the results, the Bayesian estimator in the case of a single sampling session presented the best compromise between low mean squared error and a 95\% confidence interval encompassing the parametric value of N in most simulations. Finally, when suitable field and lab protocolswere used, genotyping errors did not substantially bias population size estimates (bias{\textless}3.5\% in all simulations). The ability to reliably estimate population size fromnoninvasive samples taken during a single session offers a newand useful technique for the management and conservation of elusive and rare species.},

	doi = {10.1890/07-0443.1},
	abstract = {Spatially referenced mark-recapture data are becoming increasingly available, but the analysis of such data has remained difficult for a variety of reasons. One of the fundamental problems is that it is difficult to disentangle inherent movement behavior from sampling artifacts. For example, in a typical study design, short distances are sampled more frequently than long distances. Here we present a modeling-based alternative that combines a diffusion-based process model with an observation model to infer the inherent movement behavior of the species from the data. The movement model is based on classifying the landscape into a number of habitat types, and assuming habitat-specific diffusion and mortality parameters, and habitat selection at edges between the habitat types. As the problem is computationally highly intensive, we provide software that implements adaptive Bayesian methods for effective sampling of the posterior distribution. We illustrate the modeling framework by analyzing individual mark-recapture data on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), and by comparing our results with earlier ones derived from the same data using a purely statistical approach. We use simulated data to perform an analysis of statistical power, examining how accuracy in parameter estimates depends on the amount of data and on the study design. Obtaining precise estimates for movement rates and habitat preferences turns out to be especially challenging, as these parameters can be highly correlated in the posterior density. We show that the parameter estimates can be considerably improved by alternative study designs, such as releasing some of the individuals into the unsuitable matrix, or spending part of the recapture effort in the matrix.},

These citizen scientists are, for example, helping astronomers identify disant celestial bodies, helping biologists transk changes in plant and animal phenology at spatial and time scales never before possible, and helping ornithologists monitor bird populations by sunmitting 92,000 field observations of birds every day. Herpetology as a field stands likewise to benefit greatly from contributions by citizen scientists. Indeed, at least 66 citizen science projects are already collecting amphibian or reptile data (table 1), and 43 of these are specific to amphibians and / or reptiles. These databases have contributed significantly to our understanding of amphibian and reptile distribution and biology. However, the majority of these databases are lacking critical components that would maximize the utility of their data to herpetologiits. We argue that important advances in our understanding of reptile and amphibian distributionm abundance, and community ecology could be achieved by improving tje collection of citizen science data through the use of a centralized database that uses a checklist-based format to imply non-detections, allows the recording of effort informationm and encourages a maximal number of submission.},

	abstract = {I describe an open-source R package, multimark, for estimation of survival and abundance from capture–mark–recapture data consisting of multiple “noninvasive” marks. Noninvasive marks include natural pelt or skin patterns, scars, and genetic markers that enable individual identification in lieu of physical capture. multimark provides a means for combining and jointly analyzing encounter histories from multiple noninvasive sources that otherwise cannot be reliably matched (e.g., left- and right-sided photographs of bilaterally asymmetrical individuals). The package is currently capable of fitting open population Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) and closed population abundance models with up to two mark types using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. multimark can also be used for Bayesian analyses of conventional capture–recapture data consisting of a single-mark type. Some package features include (1) general model specification using formulas already familiar to most R users, (2) ability to include temporal, behavioral, age, cohort, and individual heterogeneity effects in detection and survival probabilities, (3) improved MCMC algorithm that is computationally faster and more efficient than previously proposed methods, (4) Bayesian multimodel inference using reversible jump MCMC, and (5) data simulation capabilities for power analyses and assessing model performance. I demonstrate use of multimark using left- and right-sided encounter histories for bobcats (Lynx rufus) collected from remote single-camera stations in southern California. In this example, there is evidence of a behavioral effect (i.e., trap “happy” response) that is otherwise indiscernible using conventional single-sided analyses. The package will be most useful to ecologists seeking stronger inferences by combining different sources of mark–recapture data that are difficult (or impossible) to reliably reconcile, particularly with the sparse datasets typical of rare or elusive species for which noninvasive sampling techniques are most commonly employed. Addressing deficiencies in currently available software, multimark also provides a user-friendly interface for performing Bayesian multimodel inference using capture–recapture data consisting of a single conventional mark or multiple noninvasive marks.},

We derive an expression for this residual variance in terms of the joint distribution of the component variables and explore how properties of the distribution affect the efficiency of tests of moderator effects. We show that tests of interactions in field studies will often have less than 20\% of the efficiency of optimal experimental tests, and we discuss implications for the design of field studies.},

Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are extreme host generalists, yet female cowbirds could use information based on past reproductive outcomes to make egg-laying decisions thus minimizing fitness costs associated with parasitizing low-quality hosts. We use a long-term (21 years) nest-box study of a single host, the prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea), to show that local cowbird reproductive success, but not host reproductive success, was positively correlated with the probability of parasitism the following year. Experimental manipulations of cowbird success corroborated that female cowbirds make future decisions about which hosts to use based on information pertaining to past cowbird success, both within and between years. The within-year pattern, in particular, points to local cowbird females selecting hosts based on past reproductive outcomes. This, coupled with high site fidelity of female cowbirds between years, points to information use, rather than cowbird natal returns alone, increasing parasitism rates on highly productive sites between years.},

Here, I simultaneously model the occupancy and detection probability of taxa, teasing apart the zeros in data that reflect true absences and those that imply non-detection of taxa that were actually present in the space and time of interest. Occupancy modeling, an approach first developed in population ecology, can easily incorporate covariates of interest, such as sampling effort and habitat variables. I use a data set of brachiopod taxa from the Paleozoic to illustrate the utility of this approach for paleontological questions. I demonstrate a range of models, including those that allow colonization between time intervals and those that incorporate facies as site covariates. I also suggest how future data collection can be improved so that process- and sampling-oriented approaches such as occupancy modeling can be applied with ease to paleobiological settings to answer important paleoecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {The bushmeat trade, or the illegal acquisition and exchange of wild meat, has long been recognised as a severe problem in forest biomes, but receives little attention in savannas, perhaps due to a misconception that bushmeat hunting is a low-impact subsistence activity. Though data on impacts are scarce, indications are that bushmeat hunting is a widespread problem in savannas, with severe impacts on wildlife populations and wildlife-based land uses. The impacts of the bushmeat trade in savannas vary from edge-effects around protected areas, to disproportionate declines of some species, to severe wildlife declines in areas with inadequate anti-poaching. In some areas, bushmeat contributes significantly to food security, but these benefits are unsustainable, and hunting is wasteful, utilising a fraction of the wildlife killed or of its financial value obtainable through tourism, trophy hunting and/or legal game meat production. The bushmeat trade appears to be becoming increasingly commercialised due to elevated demand in rural areas, urban centres and even overseas cities. Other drivers for the trade include human encroachment of wildlife areas; poverty and food insecurity; and inadequate legal frameworks to enable communities to benefit legally from wildlife, and to create incentives for people to desist from illegal bushmeat hunting. These drivers are exacerbated by inadequate wildlife laws and enforcement and in some areas, political instability. Urgent efforts are needed to address these drivers and raise awareness among local and international governments of the seriousness of the threat. Failure to address this will result in severe wildlife declines widely in African savannas, with significant ecological, economic and social impacts. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study random forests through their connection with a new framework of adaptive nearest neighbor methods. We first introduce a concept of potential nearest neighbors (k-PNN’s) and show that random forests can be seen as adaptively weighted k-PNN methods. Various aspects of random forests are then studied from this perspective. We investigate the effect of terminal node sizes and splitting schemes on the performance of random forests. It has been commonly believed that random forests work best using largest trees possible. We derive a lower bound to the rate of the mean squared error of regression random forests with non-adaptive splitting schemes and show that, asymptotically, growing largest trees in such random forests is not optimal. However, it may take a very large sample size for this asymptotic result to kick in for high dimensional problems. We illustrate with simulations the effect of terminal node sizes on the prediction accuracy of random forests with other splitting schemes. In general, it is advantageous to tune the terminal node size for best performance of random forests. We further show that random forests with adaptive splitting schemes assign weights to k-PNN’s in a desirable way: for the estimation at a given target point, these random forests assign voting weights to the k-PNN’s of the target point according to the local importance of different input variables. We propose a new simple splitting scheme that achieves desirable adaptivity in a straightforward fashion. This simple scheme can be combined with existing algorithms. The resulting algorithm is computationally faster, and gives comparable results. Other possible aspects of random forests, such as using linear combinations in splitting, are also discussed. Simulations and real datasets are used to illustrate the results.},

GAMs explained 50\%, 55\%, 46\%, and 71\% of the variance for log or square-root transformed concentrations of PB-PAH, PNC, NOx, and PM2.5, respectively, an improvement of 5\% to over 15\% over the linear models.

The red fox is known to be one of the major threats to the persistence of small and medium-sized native vertebrates across the continent. Location Australia. Methods Indices of abundance were calculated from three independently collected datasets derived from bounty returns and field surveys. Data were analysed using univariate parametric, semi-parametric and nonparametric techniques. Results Predator abundance indices did not conform to a normal distribution and the relationships between dingo and fox abundance indices were not well described by linear functions. Semi-parametric and nonparametric techniques revealed consistently negative associations between indices of dingo and fox abundance. Main conclusions The results provide evidence that mesopredator suppression by a top predator can be exerted at very large geographical scales and suggest that relationships between the abundances of top predators and mesopredators are not linear. Our results have broad implications for the management of canid predators. First, they suggest that dingoes function ecologically to reduce the activity or abundance of red foxes and thus are likely to dampen the predatory impacts of foxes. More generally, they provide support for the notion that the mesopredator-suppressive effects of top predators could be incorporated into broad-scale biodiversity conservation programmes in many parts of the world by actively maintaining populations of top predators or restoring them in areas where they are now rare. Determining the population densities at which the interactions of top predators become ecologically effective will be a critical goal for conservation managers who aim to maintain or restore ecosystems using the ecological interactions of top predators.

Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture-recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters.

To better understand the differences between human and natural mortality, we compared the extent, age and sex structure, nutritional condition, spatial and temporal distribution of human harvest, and natural predation by the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx on the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus, the most abundant wild ungulate in Europe. Compared to the human harvest, lynx were less likely to kill fawns and yearlings than adults, and among adult deer, lynx were more likely to kill females. The proportion of roe deer with fat-depleted bone marrow was higher among lynx prey than among harvested animals. Average lynx kill rate was estimated to 47.8 roe deer per year, and lynx predation was considerably lower than the human harvest in the same area. While human harvest increased with higher roe deer density, lynx predation was similar across the gradient of roe deer densities. Comparison with other countries indicated that differences between human harvest and natural mortality of ungulates vary considerably in different parts of Europe. Variation in hunting practices and, even more importantly, carnivore predation may have an important role in buffering unwanted side effects of harvest of wild ungulates. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The simplest approach, the fixed-effects (FE) model, assumes the true effect to be the same in all studies, while the random-effects (RE) family of models allows the true effect to vary across studies. However, all methods are only correct asymptotically, while some RE models assume that the true effects are normally distributed. In practice, MA methods are frequently applied when study numbers are small and the normality of the effect distribution unknown or unlikely.

We covered numerous scenarios by varying the MA sizes (small to moderate), the degree of heterogeneity (zero to very large) and the distribution of the effect sizes (normal, skew-normal and 'extremely' non-normal). Performance was evaluated in terms of coverage (Type I error), power (Type II error) and overall effect estimation (accuracy of point estimates and error intervals).},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Most studies on the relationship between home-range size and composition focus on natural factors, whereas effects of anthropogenic factors are poorly understood. I evaluated effects of multiple natural and anthropogenic habitat factors, population density, and sex on the annual home-range size of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in well-preserved forest areas in the Dinaric Mountains of Slovenia, Europe, based on {\textgreater}11,000 telemetry locations from 17 males and 25 females. Home ranges were 90-2,107 ha and averaged 460 ha. Using a mixed linear model, I estimated that home-range size decreased with increasing 1) red deer density, 2) supplemental feeding intensity, and 3) average annual temperature; 4) home-range size increased as the distance of main roads from the edge of the home range increased; and 5) males had a larger home range than females (580 ha versus 400 ha). These results were explained by effects of food availability (1, 2, and 3), energy expenditure of an individual (4 and 5), intraspecific interactions (1 and 5), and size of unfragmented habitat patches (4) on home-range size. To my knowledge, this is the 1st large mammal study to explicitly show that the density and spatial distribution of roads and supplemental feeding affect home-range size of red deer and that humans can have a greater impact on home-range size and shape than natural habitat factors. Ungulates are often supplementally fed to increase their value to hunters and to reduce forest damage, particularly in Europe; however, this practice can greatly reduce the home-range size, potentially leading to increased disease transmission and competition associated with the higher deer densities around feeding sites, which can result in just the opposite of what was intended.},

Deciding which SIMM to use is contingent on factors such as the consumer of interest, its food sources, sample size, the familiarity a user has with a particular framework for statistical analysis, or the level of inference the researcher desires to make (e.g., population- or individual-level). In this paper, we provide a review of commonly used SIMM models and describe a comprehensive SIMM that includes all features commonly used in SIMM analysis and two new features. We used data collected in Yosemite National Park to demonstrate IsotopeR's ability to estimate dietary parameters. We then examined the importance of each feature in the model and compared our results to inferences from commonly used SIMMs. IsotopeR's user interface (in R) will provide researchers a user-friendly tool for SIMM analysis. The model is also applicable for use in paleontology, archaeology, and forensic studies as well as estimating pollution inputs.},

Our goal was to understand how the foraging ecology of bears responded to changing management strategies. We found that the proportion of human foods increased in bear diets when park personnel and visitors fed bears intentionally in 1923–1971, remained relatively high and constant after artificial feeding areas were closed, and declined drastically in 1999–2007, following a \$500 000 annual government appropriation used to mitigate human–bear conflicts in the park. This reduction in the amount of human foods in bear diets suggests that Yosemite managers have been successful in reducing the availability of human foods to bears. Yosemite bears currently consume human foods in the same proportion as they did in 1915–1919. This result indicates a notable management achievement in the park, considering that thousands of people visited Yosemite annually in the early 1900s while about four million people visit each year today},

We sampled birds on their breeding ground through time and found that it took approximately 3-3.5 months for isotope values in most claw tips to equilibrate to isotope values that reflected those present in the environment on their breeding grounds. Results from this study suggest that isotopes equilibrate slowly into claw tips of Lesser Scaup, suggesting isotopes could potentially be used to determine the wintering grounds of birds.

Specifically, we analyzed the isotopic composition of hair from bears known a priori to be food-conditioned or non-food-conditioned and used these data to predict whether bears with an unknown management status were food-conditioned (FC) or non-food-conditioned (NFC). We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportional contribution of natural foods (plants and animals) versus human food in the diets of FC bears. We then used results from both analyses to evaluate proactive (population-level) and reactive (individual-level) human–bear management, and discussed new metrics to evaluate the overall human–bear management program in Yosemite. Our results indicated that 19 out of 145 (13\%) unknown bears sampled from 2005 to 2007 were food-conditioned. The proportion of human food in the diets of known FC bears likely declined from 2001–2003 to 2005–2007, suggesting proactive management was successful in reducing the amount of human food available to bears. In contrast, reactive management was not successful in changing the management status of known FC bears to NFC bears, or in reducing the contribution of human food to the diets of FC bears. Nine known FC bears were recaptured on 14 occasions from 2001 to 2007; all bears were classified as FC during subsequent recaptures, and human–bear management did not reduce the amount of human food in the diets of FC bears. Based on our results, we suggest Yosemite continue implementing proactive human–bear management, reevaluate reactive management, and consider removing problem bears (those involved in repeated bear incidents) from the population. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

Natural experiments are ideal for studying social learning, but are rare compared to captive studies because of practical limitations and ethical concerns. Such experiments are often restricted or forbidden because they require manipulation of the environment, ecology, or behavior of free-ranging species. As a result, developing new methods to investigate social learning in the field is essential. The main goal of this study was to use genetic data and a new testing framework to determine if social learning from mothers to their offspring is at least partly responsible for free-ranging black bears foraging on human foods in Yosemite National Park. I estimated a relatedness coefficient and the most probable relationship for all combinations of 2 bears (n = 150) sampled in 2004-2007. I then grouped these pairs by their foraging behavior to test predictions deduced from asocial learning, transmission, genetic inheritance, and social learning hypotheses. Results from both analyses suggest that mother-offspring social learning is the primary mechanism responsible for black bears foraging on human food in Yosemite. In addition, results also suggest that some bears are innovators, learning to forage on human food as independents. I found no support for the genetic inheritance hypothesis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

The natural complexity of ecological communities regularly lures ecologists to collect elaborate data sets in which confounding factors are often present. Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multi-collinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r {\textgreater} 0.28 or r2 -0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.},

	abstract = {* Species distribution modelling (SDM) is widely used in ecology, and predictions of species distributions inform both policy and ecological debates. Therefore, methods with high predictive accuracy and those that enable biological interpretation are preferable. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a highly flexible approach to statistical modelling and have recently been proposed for SDM. GP models fit smooth, but potentially complex response functions that can account for high-dimensional interactions between predictors. We propose fitting GP SDMs using deterministic numerical approximations, rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to make GPs more computationally efficient and easy to use. * We introduce GP models and their application to SDM, illustrate how ecological knowledge can be incorporated into GP SDMs via Bayesian priors and formulate a simple GP SDM that can be fitted efficiently. This model can be fitted either by learning the hyperparameters or by using a fixed approximation to them. Using a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey data set, we compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of these models with several commonly used SDM approaches for both presence/absence and presence-only data. * Predictive accuracy of GP SDMs fitted by Laplace approximation was greater than boosted regression trees, generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression when trained on presence/absence data and greater than all of these models plus MaxEnt when trained on presence-only data. GP SDMs fitted using a fixed approximation to hyperparameters were no less accurate than those with MAP estimation and on average 70 times faster, equivalent in speed to GAMs. * As well as having strong predictive power for this data set, GP SDMs offer a convenient method for incorporating prior knowledge of the species' ecology. By fitting these methods using efficient numerical approximations, they may easily be applied to large data sets and automatically for many species. An r package, GRaF, is provided to enable SDM users to fit GP models.},

	abstract = {1. In a rapidly changing world, understanding and predicting population change is a central aim of applied ecologists, and this involves studying the links between environmental variation and vital rates (survival, fecundity, etc.). Demographic analysis and modelling can be daunting for practicing ecologists, and here we provide an overview of some of the most important issues and methods. 2. Collection of demographic data should follow standardized protocols and the statistical power to detect links with environment is critically dependent on long time-series. Candidate environmental covariates should be carefully selected with a view to reducing the risk of spurious correlations. The relevant sample size for environment–demography links is typically the number of years and mixed models with random year effects offer a powerful framework to enforce this. 3. Data on individually marked animals are the best source of information on demography. These data can be analysed and demographic parameters estimated using a wide variety of capture–mark–recapture models, available in standard software packages. 4. Population models integrate all demographic variables and provide estimates of population growth rate. Two common classes of models are matrix models and integrated population models, where the latter combine parameter estimation and dynamic modelling. 5. Synthesis and applications.Careful demographic analysis and modelling has provided solutions for many real-world problems in population management, as well as assisting the development of general principles. The tools currently available are flexible and powerful, and the main limitations to their more general use are data availability and training.},

Such a procedure (hereafter, 'residual index') was used in 8\% and 2\% of the papers published during 1999 in the Journal of Animal Ecology and in Ecology, respectively, and has been recently recommended for studying condition. 2. Although the residual index is similar to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), it is not identical and is incorrect for at least four reasons: (i) the regression coefficient used by the residual index differs from the one used in ANCOVA and is not the least-squares estimator of the model. (ii) in contrast to the ANCOVA, the error d.f. in the residual index are overestimated because of the estimation of the regression coefficient. (iii) the residual index also assumes the homogeneity of regression coefficient (parallelism assumption), which should be tested with a special ANCOVA design. (iv) even if the assumptions of the linear model hold for the original variables, they will not hold for the residuals. 3. More importantly, the residual index is an ad hoc sequential procedure with no statistical justification, unlike the well-known ANCOVA. For these reasons, I suggest that a t-test or an ANOVA Of the residuals should never be used in place of an ANCOVA to study condition or any other variable.},

	doi = {10.1002/jwmg.727},
	abstract = {Bears foraging near human developments are often presumed to be responding to food shortage, but this explanation ignores social factors, in particular despotism in bears. We analyzed the age distribution and body condition index (BCI) of shot brown bears in relation to densities of bears and people, and whether the shot bears were killed by managers (i.e., problem bears; n = 149), in self-defense (n = 51), or were hunter-killed nonproblem bears (n = 1,896) during 1990-2010. We compared patterns between areas with (Slovenia) and without supplemental feeding (Sweden) of bears relative to 2 hypotheses. The food-search/food-competition hypothesis predicts that problem bears should have a higher BCI (e.g., exploiting easily accessible and/or nutritious human-derived foods) or lower BCI (e.g., because of food shortage) than nonproblem bears, that BCI and human density should have a positive correlation, and problem bear occurrence and seasonal mean BCI of nonproblem bears should have a negative correlation (i.e., more problem bears during years of low food availability). Food competition among bears additionally predicts an inverse relationship between BCI and bear density. The safety-search/naivety hypothesis (i.e., avoiding other bears or lack of human experience) predicts no relationship between BCI and human density, provided no dietary differences due to spatiotemporal habitat use among bears, no relationship between problem bear occurrence and seasonal mean BCI of nonproblem bears, and does not necessarily predict a difference between BCI for problem/nonproblem bears. If food competition or predation avoidance explained bear occurrence near settlements, we predicted younger problem than nonproblem bears and a negative correlation between age and human density. However, if only food search explained bear occurrence near settlements, we predicted no relation between age and problem or nonproblem bear status, or between age and human density. We found no difference in BCI or its variability between problem and nonproblem bears, no relation between BCI and human density, and no correlation between numbers of problem bears shot and seasonal mean BCI for either country. The peak of shot problem bears occurred from April to June in Slovenia and in June in Sweden (i.e., during the mating period when most intraspecific predation occurs and before fall hyperphagia). Problem bears were younger than nonproblem bears, and both problem and nonproblem bears were younger in areas of higher human density. These age differences, in combination with similarities in BCI between problem and nonproblem bears and lack of correlation between BCI and human density, suggested safety-search and naïve dispersal to be the primary mechanisms responsible for bear occurrence near settlements. Younger bears are less competitive, more vulnerable to intraspecific predation, and lack human experience, compared to adults. Body condition was inversely related to the bear density index in Sweden, whereas we found no correlation in Slovenia, suggesting that supplemental feeding may have reduced food competition, in combination with high bear harvest rates. Bears shot in self-defense were older and their BCI did not differ from that of nonproblem bears. Reasons other than food shortage apparently explained why most bears were involved in encounters with people or viewed as problematic near settlements in our study.},

A typical example is the recording of species presence in ecological surveys. In this work a Bayesian approach to the analysis of presence-only data based on a two levels scheme is presented. A probability law and a case-control design are combined to handle the double source of uncertainty: one due to censoring and the other one due to sampling. In the paper, through the use of a stratified sampling design with non-overlapping strata, a new formulation of the logistic model for presence-only data is proposed. In particular, the logistic regression with linear predictor is considered. Estimation is carried out with a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm with data augmentation, which does not require the a priori knowl- edge of the population prevalence. The performance of the new algorithm is validated by means of extensive simulation experiments using three scenarios and compar- ison with optimal benchmarks. An application to data ex- isting in literature is reported in order to discuss the model behaviour in real world situations together with the results of an original study on termites occurrences data.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.1748},
	abstract = {Single-catch traps are frequently used in live-trapping studies of small mammals. Thus far, a likelihood for single-catch traps has proven elusive and usually the likelihood for multicatch traps is used for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analyses of such data. Previous work found the multicatch likelihood to provide a robust estimator of average density. We build on a recently developed continuous-time model for SECR to derive a likelihood for single-catch traps. We use this to develop an estimator based on observed capture times and compare its performance by simulation to that of the multicatch estimator for various scenarios with nonconstant density surfaces. While the multicatch estimator is found to be a surprisingly robust estimator of average density, its performance deteriorates with high trap saturation and increasing density gradients. Moreover, it is found to be a poor estimator of the height of the detection function. By contrast, the single-catch estimators of density, distribution, and detection function parameters are found to be unbiased or nearly unbiased in all scenarios considered. This gain comes at the cost of higher variance. If there is no interest in interpreting the detection function parameters themselves, and if density is expected to be fairly constant over the survey region, then the multicatch estimator performs well with single-catch traps. However if accurate estimation of the detection function is of interest, or if density is expected to vary substantially in space, then there is merit in using the single-catch estimator when trap saturation is above about 60\%. The estimator's performance is improved if care is taken to place traps so as to span the range of variables that affect animal distribution. As a single-catch likelihood with unknown capture times remains intractable for now, researchers using single-catch traps should aim to incorporate timing devices with their traps.},

	abstract = {There is often a conservation need to estimate population abundances of elusive, low-density, wide-ranging carnivore species. Because of logistical constraints, investigators often employ non-invasive 'captures' that may involve 'genetic' or 'photographic' sampling in such cases. Established capture-recapture (CR) methods offer a powerful analytical tool for such data. In this paper, we developed a rigorous combination of captive, laboratory and field-based protocols for identifying individual tigers (Panthera tigris) from fecal DNA. We explored trade-offs between numbers of microsatellite loci used for reliable individual identifications and the need for higher capture rates for robust analyses. Our field surveys of scats were also specifically designed for CR analyses, enabling us to test for population closure, estimate capture probabilities and tiger abundance. Consequently, we could compare genetic capture estimates to results of a 'photographic capture' study of tigers at the same site. The estimates using the heterogeneity model (Mh-Jackknife) for fecal DNA survey were [Mt+1 = 26; over(over(p, ??), ??) = 0.09 and over(N, ??) (S over(E, ??) [over(N, ??)])=66 (12.98)] in close agreement with those from the photographic survey [(Mt+1 = 29; over(over(p, ??), ??) = 0.04 and over(N, ??) (S over(E, ??) [over(N, ??)]) = 66 (13.8)]. Our results revealed that designing field surveys of scats explicitly for CR data analyses generate reliable estimates of capture probability and abundance for elusive, low density species such as tigers. The study also highlights the importance of rigorous field survey and laboratory protocols for reliable abundance estimation in contexts where other approaches such as camera-trapping or physical tagging of animals may not be practical options.

The standard spatial capture–recapture design for sampling animal populations uses a fixed array of detec- tors, each operated for the same time.However,methods are needed to deal with the unbalanced data thatmay result from unevenness of effort due to logistical constraints, partial equipment failure or pooling of data for analysis. 2. Wedescribe adjustments for varying effort for three types of data eachwith a different probability distribution for the number of observations per individual per detector per sampling occasion. A linear adjustment to the expected count is appropriate for Poisson-distributed counts (e.g. faeces per searched quadrat). A linear adjust- ment on the hazard scale is appropriate for binary (Bernoulli-distributed) observations at either traps or binary proximity detectors (e.g. automatic cameras). Data pooled from varying numbers of binary detectors have a binomial distribution; adjustment is achieved by varying the size parameter of the binomial. 3. We compared a hazard-based adjustment to a more conventional covariate approach in simulations of one temporal and one spatial scenario for varying effort. The hazard-based approach was the more parsimonious and appearedmore resistant to bias and confounding. 4. Weanalysed a dataset comprisingDNAidentifications of female grizzly bearsUrsus arctos sampled asynchro- nously with hair snares in BritishColumbia in 2007. Adjustment for variation in sampling interval had negligible effect on density estimates, but unmasked an apparent decline in detection probability over the season. Dura- tion-dependent decay in sample quality is an alternative explanation for the decline that could be included in future models. 5. Allowing for known variation in effort ensures that estimates of detection probability relate to a consistent unit of effort and improves the fit of detection models. Failure to account for varying effort may result in con- founding between effort and density variation in time or space. Adjustment for effort allows rigorous analysis of unbalanced data with little extra cost in terms of precision or processing time.We suggest it should become rou- tine in capture–recapture analyses.

A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

Understanding these dynamics and a population's sensitivity to them informs conservation planning, policy decisions, recovery criteria and management triggers, especially when management actions are expensive or risky. Therefore, to inform management and conservation of the only wild, migratory population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana), we modeled its 73-year time-series of abundances and simulated future growth using Monte Carlo forecasting. We estimated the probability of the population reaching downlisting criteria. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine this population's sensitivity to periods of negative growth (i.e., annual growth rate (r) = -0.025, -0.050, -0.100, or -0.150 for 1-3 consecutive years). We found this population exhibiting periodic declines on a 10-year cycle. We show it is unlikely to go extinct assuming conditions remain similar to the past. Our forecasts suggested the population will contain {\textgreater}400 birds by 2025. We found ???3 consecutive years of r??? -0.1 or ???2 consecutive years of r??? -0.15 must occur to significantly reduce abundance from the current trajectory and delay recovery. Favorably, the probability of reaching 400 birds by 2040 was 0.892 for the worst scenario. Such a scenario has only occurred once in 73. years of monitoring. Our simulations provide managers and policy makers information for evaluating recovery timelines, while forecasts aid setting habitat conservation targets. By describing how the population responds to periods of negative growth (natural or manmade), we identify management triggers, while informing monitoring frequency. Furthermore, our analyses provide a framework for moving discussions away from short-term, reactive decisions such as supplemental feeding, aquaculture, or small-scale freshwater provisioning, to long-term conservation approaches. ?? 2013.},

Estimates of wild ungulate populations were obtained from the literature and we extrapolated their trend in the period considered. Differences among geographic areas (south-central Apennines, northern Apennines, and western Alps) were tested by nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance, while the trends of the wild ungulate and livestock use and of diet breadth were analysed by regression and curve-fit analyses. We used the same method to support the relationships between the use and availability of wild ungulates. Wolves preyed on wild herbivores more in the northern Apennines and in the western Alps than in the southern Apennines; the contrary was the case for livestock. Among wild ungulate species, wild boar, roe deer and red deer were the main prey of the wolf. The occurrence of wild ungulates in the wolf diet increased from 1976 to 2004 together with a decrease of livestock; the increase was mainly due to roe deer, red deer and chamois. The results of scat analysis in the province of Genoa showed an increase of the occurrence of wild ungulates from 1987 to 2005, in particular roe deer and fallow deer.

In this study, we demonstrate two approaches to the use of multiple sources of information on a parameter of fundamental interest to ecologists: animal density. The first approach produces estimates simultaneously from two different sources of data. The second approach was developed for situations in which initial data collection and analysis are followed up by subsequent data collection and prior knowledge is updated with new data using a stepwise process. Both approaches are used to estimate density of a rare and elusive predator, the tiger, by combining photographic and fecal DNA spatial capture– recapture data. The model, which combined information, provided the most precise estimate of density (8.5 6 1.95 tigers/100 km2 [posterior mean 6 SD]) relative to a model that utilized only one data source (photographic, 12.02 6 3.02 tigers/100 km2 and fecal DNA, 6.65 6 2.37 tigers/100 km2). Our study demonstrates that, by accounting for multiple sources of available information, estimates of animal density can be significantly improved.},

	abstract = {Most studies dealing with home ranges consider the study areas as if they were totally flat, working only in two dimensions, when in reality they are irregular surfaces displayed in three dimensions. By disregarding the third dimension (i.e., topography), the size of home ranges underestimates the surface actually occupied by the animal, potentially leading to misinterpretations of the animals' ecological needs. We explored the influence of considering the third dimension in the estimation of home-range size by modeling the variation between the planimetric and topographic estimates at several spatial scales. Our results revealed that planimetric approaches underestimate home-range size estimations, which range from nearly zero up to 22\%. The difference between planimetric and topographic estimates of home-ranges sizes produced highly robust models using the average slope as the sole independent factor. Moreover, our models suggest that planimetric estimates in areas with an average slope of 16.3° (±0.4) or more will incur in errors ≥5\%. Alternatively, the altitudinal range can be used as an indicator of the need to include topography in home-range estimates. Our results confirmed that home-range estimates could be significantly biased when topography is disregarded. We suggest that study areas where home-range studies will be performed should firstly be scoped for its altitudinal range, which can serve as an indicator for the need for posterior use of average slope values to model the surface area used and/or available for the studied animals.},

Here we investigate the impact that the choice of model can have on predictions, identify key reasons why model output may differ and discuss the implications that model uncertainty has for policy-guiding applications. Location The Western Cape of South Africa. Methods We applied nine of the most widely used modelling techniques to model potential distributions under current and predicted future climate for four species (including two subspecies) of Proteaceae. Each model was built using an identical set of five input variables and distribution data for 3996 sampled sites. We compare model predictions by testing agreement between observed and simulated distributions for the present day (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa statistics) and by assessing consistency in predictions of range size changes under future climate (using cluster analysis). Results Our analyses show significant differences between predictions from different models, with predicted changes in range size by 2030 differing in both magnitude and direction (e.g. from 92\% loss to 322\% gain). We explain differences with reference to two characteristics of the modelling techniques: data input requirements (presence/absence vs. presence-only approaches) and assumptions made by each algorithm when extrapolating beyond the range of data used to build the model. The effects of these factors should be carefully considered when using this modelling approach to predict species ranges. Main Conclusions We highlight an important source of uncertainty in assessments of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and emphasize that model predictions should be interpreted in policy-guiding applications along with a full appreciation of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Aim: Advancement in ecological methods predicting species distributions is a crucial precondition for deriving sound management actions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are a popular tool to predict species distributions, as they are considered able to cope well with sparse, irregularly sampled data and minor location errors. Although a fundamental assumption of MaxEnt is that the entire area of interest has been systematically sampled, in practice, MaxEnt models are usually built from occurrence records that are spatially biased towards better-surveyed areas. Two common, yet not compared, strategies to cope with uneven sampling effort are spatial filtering of occurrence data and background manipulation using environmental data with the same spatial bias as occurrence data. We tested these strategies using simulated data and a recently collated dataset on Malay civet Viverra tangalunga in Borneo. Location: Borneo, Southeast Asia. Methods: We collated 504 occurrence records of Malay civets from Borneo of which 291 records were from 2001 to 2011 and used them in the MaxEnt analysis (baseline scenario) together with 25 environmental input variables. We simulated datasets for two virtual species (similar to a range-restricted highland and a lowland species) using the same number of records for model building. As occurrence records were biased towards north-eastern Borneo, we investigated the efficacy of spatial filtering versus background manipulation to reduce overprediction or underprediction in specific areas. Results: Spatial filtering minimized omission errors (false negatives) and commission errors (false positives). We recommend that when sample size is insufficient to allow spatial filtering, manipulation of the background dataset is preferable to not correcting for sampling bias, although predictions were comparatively weak and commission errors increased. Main Conclusions: We conclude that a substantial improvement in the quality of model predictions can be achieved if uneven sampling effort is taken into account, thereby improving the efficacy of species conservation planning. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Building on Hutchinson’s concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set describing the whole study area. The first factor extracted maximizes the marginality of the focal species, defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended in situations where absence data are not available (many data banks), unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders).

	abstract = {Geospatial species sample data (e.g., records with location information from natural history museums or annual surveys) are rarely collected optimally, yet are increasingly used for decisions concerning our biological heritage. Using computer simulations, we examined factors that could affect the performance of autologistic regression (ALR) models that predict species occurrence based on environmental variables and spatially correlated presence/absence data. We used a factorial experiment design to examine the effects of survey design, spatial contiguity, and species detection probability and applied the results of ten replications of each factorial combination to an ALR model. We used additional simulations to assess the effects of sample size and environmental data error on model performance. Predicted distribution maps were compared to simulated distribution maps, considered "truth," and evaluated using several metrics: omission and commission error counts, residual sums of squares (RSS), and areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Generally, model performance was better using random and stratified survey designs than when using other designs. Adaptive survey designs were an exception to this generalization under the omission error performance criterion. Surveys using rectangular quadrats, designed to emulate roadside surveys, resulted in models with better performance than those using square quadrats (using AUC, RSS, and omission error metrics) and were most similar in performance to a systematic quadrat design. Larger detection probabilities, larger sample sizes, contiguous distributions, and fewer environmental data errors generally improved model performance. Results suggest that spatially biased sample data, e.g., data collected along roads, could result in model performance near that of systematic quadrat designs even in the presence of potentially confounding factors such as contiguity of distributions, detection probability, sample size, and environmental data error. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.

	abstract = {Effective population size (Ne ) is a key parameter for monitoring the genetic health of threatened populations because it reflects a population's evolutionary potential and risk of extinction due to genetic stochasticity. However, its application to wildlife monitoring has been limited because it is difficult to measure in natural populations. The isolated and well-studied population of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem provides a rare opportunity to examine the usefulness of different Ne estimators for monitoring. We genotyped 729 Yellowstone grizzly bears using 20 microsatellites and applied three single-sample estimators to examine contemporary trends in generation interval (GI), effective number of breeders (Nb ) and Ne during 1982-2007. We also used multisample methods to estimate variance (NeV ) and inbreeding Ne (NeI ). Single-sample estimates revealed positive trajectories, with over a fourfold increase in Ne (≈100 to 450) and near doubling of the GI (≈8 to 14) from the 1980s to 2000s. NeV (240-319) and NeI (256) were comparable with the harmonic mean single-sample Ne (213) over the time period. Reanalysing historical data, we found NeV increased from ≈80 in the 1910s-1960s to ≈280 in the contemporary population. The estimated ratio of effective to total census size (Ne /Nc ) was stable and high (0.42-0.66) compared to previous brown bear studies. These results support independent demographic evidence for Yellowstone grizzly bear population growth since the 1980s. They further demonstrate how genetic monitoring of Ne can complement demographic-based monitoring of Nc and vital rates, providing a valuable tool for wildlife managers.},

	abstract = {* Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare. * We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (‘function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees. * No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models. * Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non-function-valued approaches.},

	abstract = {The status of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Spain has suffered a dramatic decline during the last centuries, both in area and numbers. Current relict populations are suspected to be under immediate risk of extinction. The aim of our model is to attain an understanding of the main processes and mechanisms determining population dynamics in the Cordillera Cantabrica. We compile the knowledge available about brown bears in the Cordillera Cantabrica, northern Spain, and perform a population viability analysis (PVA) to diagnose the current state of the population and to support current management. The specially constructed simulation model, based on long-term field investigations on the western brown bear population in the Cordillera Cantabrica, includes detailed life history data and information on environmental variations in food abundance. The method of in- dividual-based modeling is employed to simulate the fate of individual bears. Reproduction, family breakup, and mortalities are modeled in annual time steps under the influence of environmental variations in food abundance, mortality rates, and reproductive parameters. In parallel, we develop an analytical model that describes the mean behavior of the pop- ulation and that enables us to perform a detailed sensitivity analysis. We determine current population parameters by iterating the model with plausible values and compare simulation results with the 1982-1995 time pattern of observed number of females with cubs of the year. Our results indicate that the population suffered a mean annual decrease of -4-5\% during the study period, 1982-1995. This decrease could be explained by a coincidence of high poaching pressure with a series of climatically unfa- vorable years during the period 1982-1988. Thereafter, population size probably stabilized. We estimate that the population currently consists of 25 or 26 independent females and a total of 50-60 individuals. However, our viability analysis shows that the population does not satisfy the criterion of a minimum viable population if mortalities remain at the level of the last few years of 1988-1995. The "salvation" of at least one independent female every three years is required. The population retains relatively high reproductive parameters, indicating good nutritive conditions of the habitat, but mortality rates are higher than those known in other brown bear populations. The most sensitive parameters, adult and subadult mortality of females, form the principal management target. Our model shows that the series of females with cubs contains valuable information on the state of the population. We recommend moni- toring of females with cubs as the most important management action, both for collecting data and for safeguarding the most sensitive part of the population},

We argue that appropriate model calibration procedures can access additional sources of informa- tion, compensating the lack of direct parameter estimates. Our objective is to show how model calibration using population-level data can facilitate the construction of SEPMs that produce reliable predictions for conservation even when direct parameter estimates are inadequate.We constructed a spatially explicit and individual-based population model for the dynamics of brown bears (Ursus arctos) after a reintroduction program in Austria. To calibrate the model we developed a procedure that compared the simulated population dynamics with distinct fea- tures of the known population dynamics (=patterns). This procedure detected model param- eterizations that did not reproduce the known dynamics. Global sensitivity analysis of the uncalibratedmodel revealed high uncertainty in most model predictions due to large parameter uncertainties (coefficients of variation CV≈0.8). However, the calibrated model yielded pre- dictions with considerably reduced uncertainty (CV≈0.2). A pattern or a combination of various patterns that embed information on the entire model dynamics can reduce the uncer- tainty in model predictions, and the application of different patterns with high information content yields the same model predictions. In contrast, a pattern that does not embed infor- mation on the entire population dynamics (e.g., bear observations taken from sub-areas of the study area) does not reduce uncertainty in model predictions. Because population-level data for defining (multiple) patterns are often available, our approach could be applied widely},

	abstract = {Capture-recapture studies are frequently used to monitor the status and trends of wildlife populations. Detection histories from individual animals are used to estimate probability of detection and abundance or density. The accuracy of abundance and density estimates depends on the ability to model factors affecting detection probability. Non-spatial capture-recapture models have recently evolved into spatial capture-recapture models that directly include the effect of distances between an animal’s home range centre and trap locations on detection probability. Most studies comparing non-spatial and spatial capture-recapture biases focussed on single year models and no studies have compared the accuracy of demographic parameter estimates from open population models. We applied open population non-spatial and spatial capture-recapture models to three years of grizzly bear DNA-based data from Banff National Park and simulated data sets. The two models produced similar estimates of grizzly bear apparent survival, per capita recruitment, and population growth rates but the spatial capture-recapture models had better fit. Simulations showed that spatial capture-recapture models produced more accurate parameter estimates with better credible interval coverage than non-spatial capture-recapture models. Non-spatial capture-recapture models produced negatively biased estimates of apparent survival and positively biased estimates of per capita recruitment. The spatial capture-recapture grizzly bear population growth rates and 95\% highest posterior density averaged across the three years were 0.925 (0.786–1.071) for females, 0.844 (0.703–0.975) for males, and 0.882 (0.779–0.981) for females and males combined. The non-spatial capture-recapture population growth rates were 0.894 (0.758–1.024) for females, 0.825 (0.700–0.948) for males, and 0.863 (0.771–0.957) for both sexes. The combination of low densities, low reproductive rates, and predominantly negative population growth rates suggest that Banff National Park’s population of grizzly bears requires continued conservation-oriented management actions.},

	abstract = {Use of single-sample genetic methods to estimate effective population size has skyrocketed in recent years. Although the underlying models assume discrete generations, they are widely applied to age-structured species. We simulated genetic data for 21 iteroparous animal and plant species to evaluate two untested hypotheses regarding performance of the single-sample method based on linkage-disequilibrium (LD): 1) estimates based on single-cohort samples reflect the effective number of breeders in one reproductive cycle (Nb); and 2) mixed-age samples reflect the effective size per generation (Ne). We calculated true Ne and Nb using the model species' vital rates and verified these with individual-based simulations. We show that single-cohort samples should be equally influenced by Nb and Ne and confirm this with simulated results: Nb was a linear (r(2) = 0.98) function of the harmonic mean of Ne and Nb. We provide a quantitative bias correction for raw Nb based on the ratio Nb/Ne, which can be estimated from two or three simple life history traits. Bias-adjusted estimates were within 5\% of true Nb for all 21 study species and proved robust when challenged with new data. Mixed-age adult samples produced downwardly-biased estimates in all species, which we attribute to a two-locus Wahlund effect (mixture LD) caused by combining parents from different cohorts in a single sample. Results from this study will facilitate interpretation of rapidly-accumulating genetic estimates in terms of both Ne (which influences long-term evolutionary processes) and Nb (which is more important for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics and mating systems).},

Results of this study are as follows: (1) Low-frequency alleles upwardly bias {\textasciicircum}Ne, but a simple rule can reduce bias to {\textless}about 10\% without sacrificing much precision. (2) With datasets routinely available today (10–20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals), precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (Ne {\textless} 200), and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However, it is very difficult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations. (3) With ‘microsatellite’ data, the LD method has greater precision than the temporal method, unless the latter is based on samples taken many generations apart. Our results indicate the LD method has widespread applicability to conservation (which typically focuses on small populations) and the study of evolutionary processes in local populations. Considerable opportunity exists to extract more information about Ne in nature by wider use of single-sample estimators and by combining estimates from different methods.},

Nb can be used as a proxy for Ne and also can provide crucial insights into eco-evolutionary processes that occur during reproduction. We used analytical and numerical methods to evaluate effects of intermittent breeding and litter/clutch size on inbreeding Nb and Ne . Fixed or random litter sizes ≥ 3 have little effect on either effective-size parameter; however, in species (e.g., many large mammals) in which females can produce only one offspring per cycle, female Nb = ∞ and overall Nb = 4Nb (male) . Intermittent breeding reduces the pool of female breeders, which reduces both female and overall Nb ; reductions are larger in high-fecundity species with high juvenile mortality and increase when multiple reproductive cycles are skipped. Simulated data for six model species showed that both intermittent breeding and litter-size constraints increase Ne , but only slightly. We show how to quantitatively account for these effects, which are important to consider when (1) using Nb to estimate Ne , or (2) drawing inferences about male reproductive success based on estimates of female Nb .},

	abstract = {Strategies to minimize dengue transmission commonly rely on vector control, which aims to maintain Ae. aegypti density below a theoretical threshold. Mosquito abundance is traditionally estimated from mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments, which lack proper analysis regarding accurate vector spatial distribution and population density. Recently proposed strategies to control vector-borne diseases involve replacing the susceptible wild population by genetically modified individuals' refractory to the infection by the pathogen. Accurate measurements of mosquito abundance in time and space are required to optimize the success of such interventions. In this paper, we present a hierarchical probabilistic model for the estimation of population abundance and spatial distribution from typical mosquito MRR experiments, with direct application to the planning of these new control strategies. We perform a Bayesian analysis using the model and data from two MRR experiments performed in a neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during both low- and high-dengue transmission seasons. The hierarchical model indicates that mosquito spatial distribution is clustered during the winter (0.99 mosquitoes/premise 95\% CI: 0.80-1.23) and more homogeneous during the high abundance period (5.2 mosquitoes/premise 95\% CI: 4.3-5.9). The hierarchical model also performed better than the commonly used Fisher-Ford's method, when using simulated data. The proposed model provides a formal treatment of the sources of uncertainty associated with the estimation of mosquito abundance imposed by the sampling design. Our approach is useful in strategies such as population suppression or the displacement of wild vector populations by refractory Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, since the invasion dynamics have been shown to follow threshold conditions dictated by mosquito abundance. The presence of spatially distributed abundance hotspots is also formally addressed under this modeling framework and its knowledge deemed crucial to predict the fate of transmission control strategies based on the replacement of vector populations.},

Conservation projects should be based on a sound knowledge of the patterns of wildcat distri- bution, population size and dynamics. However, this informa- tion is scanty, mainly because of the species’ elusive behav- iour. In this study, we tested the efficiency of a protocol that integrates the use of non-invasive genetic identifications and camera trapping for wildcat monitoring. The field work was carried out in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park, a protected area in the central Italian Apennines, where wildcat presence has been recently ascertained. DNA samples were extracted from scats collected during the survey and hair tufts trapped by valerian-treated sticks. Individual genotypes were identified using 10 autosomal microsatellites, mtDNA and Y chromosome markers. Additionally, we obtained 30-s long video clips from 20 camera trap stations associated to the hair traps. Our results confirmed the presence of wildcats in the study area. We identified six to nine wildcat individuals (re- spectively from non-invasive genetic sampling and camera trapping survey). Some of these showed anomalous coat col- our patterns (one) or genetic signatures of hybridization (three).We further identified five domestic cats that were shar- ing parts of wildcats’ territories. We found individual varia- tions in the response to valerian lure.We compared and eval- uated the pros and cons of these monitoring methods. We concluded that, if used simultaneously, these methods may considerably increase the efficiency of wildcat detection and the quality of collected data.},

	abstract = {To date, the processing of wildlife location data has relied on a diversity of software and file formats. Data management and the following spatial and statistical analyses were undertaken in multiple steps, involving many time-consuming importing/exporting phases. Recent technological advancements in tracking systems have made large, continuous, high-frequency datasets of wildlife behavioural data available, such as those derived from the global positioning system (GPS) and other animal-attached sensor devices. These data can be further complemented by a wide range of other information about the animals' environment. Management of these large and diverse datasets for modelling animal behaviour and ecology can prove challenging, slowing down analysis and increasing the probability of mistakes in data handling. We address these issues by critically evaluating the requirements for good management of GPS data for wildlife biology. We highlight that dedicated data management tools and expertise are needed. We explore current research in wildlife data management. We suggest a general direction of development, based on a modular software architecture with a spatial database at its core, where interoperability, data model design and integration with remote-sensing data sources play an important role in successful GPS data handling.},

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest ("derived quantities") are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional "plug-in" estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new "epsilon" estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

Despite this, predation strategies of humans are rarely in- corporated into quantitative assessments of the demographic impacts of humans killing car- nivores. This scarcity largely seems to be caused by a lack of data. In this study, we contrasted predation strategies exhibited by people involved in retaliatory killing and recrea- tional sport hunting of leopards (Panthera pardus) in the Waterberg District Municipality, South Africa. We predicted a specialist predation strategy exemplified by a type II functional response for retaliatory killing, and a generalist strategy exemplified by a type III functional response for recreational sport hunting. Wecould not distinguish between a type I, a type II, or a type III functional response for retaliatory killing, but the most parsimonious model for recreational sport hunting corresponded to a type I functional response. Kill rates were con- sistently higher for retaliatory killing than for recreational sport hunting. Our results indicate that retaliatory killing of leopards may have severe demographic consequences for leopard populations, whereas the demographic consequences of recreational sport hunting likely are less dramatic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that ecological heterogeneity across space can influence the genetic structure of populations, including that of long-distance dispersers such as large carnivores. On the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, wolf (Canis lupus L., 1758) dietary niche and parasite prevalence data indicate strong ecological divergence between marine-oriented wolves inhabiting islands and individuals on the coastal mainland that interact primarily with terrestrial prey. Local holders of traditional ecological knowledge, who distinguish between mainland and island wolf forms, also informed our hypothesis that genetic differentiation might occur between wolves from these adjacent environments. RESULTS: We used microsatellite genetic markers to examine data obtained from wolf faecal samples. Our results from 116 individuals suggest the presence of a genetic cline between mainland and island wolves. This pattern occurs despite field observations that individuals easily traverse the 30 km wide study area and swim up to 13 km among landmasses in the region. CONCLUSIONS: Natal habitat-biased dispersal (i.e., the preference for dispersal into familiar ecological environments) might contribute to genetic differentiation. Accordingly, this working hypothesis presents an exciting avenue for future research where marine resources or other components of ecological heterogeneity are present.},

	abstract = {The development of methods for dealing with continuous data with a spike at zero has lagged behind those for overdispersed or zero-inflated count data. We consider longitudinal ecological data corresponding to an annual average of 26 weekly maximum counts of birds, and are hence effectively continuous, bounded below by zero but also with a discrete mass at zero. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical Tweedie regression model that can directly accommodate the excess number of zeros common to this type of data, whilst accounting for both spatial and temporal correlation. Implementation of the model is conducted in a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, using reversible jump MCMC to explore uncertainty across both parameter and model spaces. This regression modelling framework is very flexible and removes the need to make strong assumptions about mean-variance relationships a priori. It can also directly account for the spike at zero, whilst being easily applicable to other types of data and other model formulations. Whilst a correlative study such as this cannot prove causation, our results suggest that an increase in an avian predator may have led to an overall decrease in the number of one of its prey species visiting garden feeding stations in the United Kingdom. This may reflect a change in behaviour of house sparrows to avoid feeding stations frequented by sparrowhawks, or a reduction in house sparrow population size as a result of sparrowhawk increase.},

Additional information on the location of and divergence between population clusters is required, particularly because wolves are currently recolonizing parts of Europe. We evaluated genetic structure in 177 wolves from 11 countries using over 67K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. The results supported previous findings of an isolated Italian population with lower genetic diversity than that observed across other areas of Europe. Wolves from the remaining countries were primarily structured in a north-south axis, with Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece (Dinaric-Balkan) differentiated from northcentral wolves that included individuals from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia. Carpathian Mountain wolves in central Europe had genotypes intermediate between those identified in northcentral Europe and the Dinaric-Balkan cluster. Overall, individual genotypes from northcentral Europe suggested high levels of admixture. We observed high diversity within Belarus, with wolves from western and northern Belarus representing the two most differentiated groups within northcentral Europe. Our results support the presence of at least three major clusters (Italy, Carpathians, Dinaric-Balkan) in southern and central Europe. Individuals from Croatia also appeared differentiated from wolves in Greece and Bulgaria. Expansion from glacial refugia, adaptation to local environments, and human-related factors such as landscape fragmentation and frequent killing of wolves in some areas may have contributed to the observed patterns. Our findings can help inform conservation management of these apex predators and the ecosystems of which they are part.},

If these predictor variables are measured with error and subsequently used in the analysis, then estimates of the model parameters may be biased. Several approaches have been proposed to account for error-in-variables in capture-recapture models, however these methods generally assume the population is closed; hence quantities of interest for open populations such as the survival probabilities do not appear in the likelihood. To account for measurement error in environmental time-varying covariates for open population capture-recapture data, the well-known Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and two statistical methods are considered: (1) simulation-extrapolation; and (2) regression calibration, as well as a new method which accounts for correlation (arising from measurement error) between the survival and capture probabilities. Several simulation studies are conducted to examine the method performances, and a case study is presented which uses capture-recapture data on the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor and sea-surface temperature data as an environmental covariate to model their survival and capture probabilities.},

The endangered orangutan (Pongo spp.) is an example; due to its elusive behavior and low densities, researchers have relied on methods that convert nest counts to orangutan densities and require substantial effort for reliable results. Camera trapping and spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models could provide an alternative but have not been used for primates. We compared density estimates calculated using the two methods for orangutans in the Wehea Forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Camera trapping/SCR modeling produced a density estimate of 0.16±0.09–0.29 indiv/km2, and nest counts produced a density estimate of 1.05±0.18–6.01 indiv/km2. The large confidence interval of the nest count estimate is probably due to high variance in nest encounter rates, indicating the need for larger sample size and the substantial effort required to produce reliable results using this method. The SCR estimate produced a very low density estimate and had a narrower but still fairly wide confidence interval. This was likely due to unmodeled heterogeneity and small sample size, specifically a low number of individual captures and recaptures. We propose methodological fixes that could address these issues and improve precision. A comparison of the overall costs and benefits of the two methods suggests that camera trapping/SCR modeling can potentially be a useful tool for assessing the densities of orangutans and other elusive primates, and warrant further investigation to determine broad applicability and methodological adjustments needed.},

The relative success of these classes of traps is the basis for the area estimate. The method was validated by computer simulation, which showed its accuracy to be sensitive to trap interval but insensitive to grid shape and animal density. Grids as small as five rows produced good density estimates. The range of error in density estimates was 0 to 15\%. The method was also applied to data from field populations of unknown density.},

	abstract = {Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models are a relatively recent development in quantitative ecology, and they are becoming widely used to model density in studies of animal populations using camera traps, DNA sampling and other methods which produce spatially explicit individual encounter information. One of the core assumptions of SCR models is that individuals possess home ranges that are spatially stationary during the sampling period. For many species, this assumption is unlikely to be met and, even for species that are typically territorial, individuals may disperse or exhibit transience at some life stages. In this paper we first conduct a simulation study to evaluate the robustness of estimators of density under ordinary SCR models when dispersal or transience is present in the population. Then, using both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that such models can easily be described in the BUGS language providing a practical framework for their analysis, which allows us to evaluate movement dynamics of species using capture–recapture data. We find that while estimators of density are extremely robust, even to pathological levels of movement (e.g., complete transience), the estimator of the spatial scale parameter of the encounter probability model is confounded with the dispersal/transience scale parameter. Thus, use of ordinary SCR models to make inferences about density is feasible, but interpretation of SCR model parameters in relation to movement should be avoided. Instead, when movement dynamics are of interest, such dynamics should be parameterized explicitly in the model.},

Knowledge of spatial patterns in occupancy and the spatial and/or temporal patterns in detect- ability allows for stratification of traps and improved detection rates. This study investigated how local variation in habitats affected the detectability of grizzly bears in west–central Alberta when monitored with a fixed DNA hair snag design. Bear hair samples were collected in 2011 at 60 sites across 1500 km2 over six sessions, each 14 days in length, between June and August. Microsatellite analysis of hair samples revealed grizzly bear detections at 25 of 60 sites and 21 individual bears. We investigated occupancy and detectability of grizzly bears at the patch and landscape scales using detection histories and program PRESENCE. At the patch scale, grizzly bear detection was highest when sites were placed near streams with clover and in intermediate levels of forest crown closure. At the landscape scale, probability of detection increased near streams and oil and gas wellsites, especially when food resources and wellsite density in the surrounding area was low. Our results highlight the importance of considering local food resources and habitat conditions during placement of fixed DNA hair snag sites. Detectability was not found to vary over time, suggesting that sampling in west–central Alberta can occur at any time between June and August.},

We sought to understand (i) whether there is a perception that new methods are underused, (ii) what the barriers to use of new methods are, (iii) what dissemination activities are used, and (iv) user preferences for learning about new methods.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of members of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) and of principal investigators (knowledge-users) funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: There were 157 CIHR respondents (14\% response rate), and 39 respondents were statisticians from the Statistical Society of Canada. Seventy percent of CIHR respondents and 82\% of statisticians felt that new developments were under-used. Barriers to use of new methods included lack of access to the necessary expertise (selected by over 90\% of respondents), lack of suitable software (selected by 81\% of statisticians), and lack of time to implement new methods (selected by 78\% of statisticians). Greater access to statistical colleagues with an interest in collaboration and availability of software to implement new methods were the top-rated preferences among knowledge-users.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: There was a clear perception among all respondents that new statistical methods are underused.

Spatially and temporally explicit vector fields were estimated using approximating difference equations and nonparametric regression techniques. Estimated vector fields of movement were mapped onto the project area at selected times of the day to examine spatial patterns of movement in relation to topography. Using the concept of a potential function, we were able to study the influence of roads and grassland foraging areas on elk movements. Doing so we identified broad spatial patterns of elk movements and showed the time dependent effects of habitat features within the habitat mosaic at Starkey. Our analyses quantify the cycles ofmovements in spring and summer in terms of attraction or repulsion to specific habitat features, and illustrate the magnitude, timing and direction of these movements.

We confirm that f and heterozygosity is poorly correlated in a wild and highly inbred wolf population. Yet, our data show that for each level of f, it was the most heterozygous wolves that established themselves as breeders, a selection process that seems to have decelerated the loss of heterozygosity in the population despite a steady increase of f. The markers contributing to the positive relationship between heterozygosity and breeding success were found to be located on different chromosomes, but there was a substantial amount of linkage disequilibrium in the population, indicating that the markers are reflecting heterozygosity over relatively wide genomic regions. Following our results we recommend that management programs of endangered populations include estimates of both f and heterozygosity, as they may contribute with complementary information about population viability.},

	abstract = {Although the mechanisms controlling gene flow among populations are particularly important for evolutionary processes, they are still poorly understood, especially in the case of large carnivoran mammals with extensive continuous distributions. We studied the question of factors affecting population genetic structure in the grey wolf, Canis lupus, one of the most mobile terrestrial carnivores. We analysed variability in mitochondrial DNA and 14 microsatellite loci for a sample of 643 individuals from 59 localities representing most of the continuous wolf range in Eastern Europe. We tested an array of geographical, historical and ecological factors to check whether they may explain genetic differentiation among local wolf populations. We showed that wolf populations in Eastern Europe displayed nonrandom spatial genetic structure in the absence of obvious physical barriers to movement. Neither topographic barriers nor past fragmentation could explain spatial genetic structure. However, we found that the genetic differentiation among local populations was correlated with climate, habitat types, and wolf diet composition. This result shows that ecological processes may strongly influence the amount of gene flow among populations. We suggest natal-habitat-biased dispersal as an underlying mechanism linking population ecology with population genetic structure. 2006 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Experiments were performed to study the effects of short and long-term exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) on a freshwater crustacean isopod Asellus aquaticus (L.). Two life stages of isopods were exposed to a range of BPA concentrations, from aqueous and two dietary sources, in the form of with BPA spiked conditioned alder leaf (Alnus glutinosa) discs, or spiked formulated sediment, to determine the relative importance of each source of exposure on the uptake of this contaminant. Several lethal and sublethal endpoints were evaluated in this study to measure the potential effects of BPA on A. aquaticus, including mortality, growth and feeding rate inhibition, mobility inhibition, de-pigmentation and molting disturbances. They signify a correlation to BPA levels and a difference in BPA uptake efficiency from different uptake sources. Results of acute exposure to BPA show a greater sensitivity of test systems using juvenile specimens with a 96h LC50 of 8.6mgL-1 BPA in water medium and a 96h LC50 of 13.5mgL-1 BPA in sediment. In comparison, adult isopods show a 96h LC50 of 25.1mgL-1 BPA in water medium and a 96h LC50 of 65.1mgL-1 BPA in sediment. Observed endpoints of chronic exposures suggest the alder leave discs to be the most efficient uptake source of BPA, in contrast to uptake from water or heterogeneous sediment. Significant (p{\textless}0.05) growth inhibition, with a 21d NOEC of 0.5/2.5mgL-1 (for juvenile/adult organisms), and feeding rate inhibition, with a 21d NOEC of 0.5/1.0mgL-1 (for juvenile/adult organisms), were proven to be the most sensitive toxicity endpoints. An even more sensitive effect turned out to be molting frequency, which was significantly reduced; a 21d NOEC was 1.0mgL-1 of BPA for adult organisms and an even lower 21d NOEC of 0.05mgL-1 of BPA for juveniles. The observed endpoints are recorded at very low, non-toxic exposure concentrations, indicating that BPA acts as an endocrine disrupting compound, as well as a toxic substance. We also determined the importance of the direct dietary uptake of the pollutants, significant for juveniles as well as adult animals.},

However, these morphological discontinuities are not always consistent with patterns of genetic differentiation. Here we assess genetic distinctiveness of grey wolves from the Caucasus (a region at the border between Europe and West Asia) that have been classified as a distinct subspecies C. l. cubanensis. We analysed their genetic variability based on mtDNA control region, microsatellite loci and genome-wide SNP genotypes (obtained for a subset of the samples), and found similar or higher levels of genetic diversity at all these types of loci as compared with other Eurasian populations. Although we found no evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck, genome-wide linkage disequilibrium patterns suggest a long-term demographic decline in the Caucasian population--a trend consistent with other Eurasian populations. Caucasian wolves share mtDNA haplotypes with both Eastern European and West Asian wolves, suggesting past or ongoing gene flow. Microsatellite data also suggest gene flow between the Caucasus and Eastern Europe. We found evidence for moderate admixture between the Caucasian wolves and domestic dogs, at a level comparable with other Eurasian populations. Taken together, our results show that Caucasian wolves are not genetically isolated from other Eurasian populations, share with them the same demographic trends, and are affected by similar conservation problems.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores are declining worldwide and few examples of successful reintroductions exist, because of their large home-ranges, low reproductive rates, and penchant for human-wildlife conflict that is the main cause of their decline. Moreover, few studies assess whether habitat suitability predicted before reintroduction, a critical evaluation step, matches post-reintroduction habitat selection. We examined habitat-related factors contributing to a successful brown bear (Ursus arctos) reintroduction in central Europe. Starting in 1999, 10 brown bears were translocated from Slovenia to Trentino in the Italian Alps, and this population has since grown by {\textgreater}10\%/year. First, we estimated multi-scale resource selection functions (RSF) with GPS collar data and validated models with k-folds cross validation and external VHF data. Then, we used Kappa-statistics to compare our population-scale RSF with a habitat suitability model (HSM) developed to predict potential habitat before reintroduction. Lastly, we employed least-cost path (LCP) analyses integrating our within home-range scale RSF to define movement paths. Overall, the HSM predicted post-reintroduction habitat selection well in many areas, but bears used orchards and shrubs more, and mixed/conifer forests and pastures less than expected prior to reintroduction. Finally, we identified road crossings of predicted paths between preferred habitat patches. We found two potential crossings in the Adige Valley, likely the biggest constraint for the study population to expand eastward and impeding dispersal to/from the closest bear population (Dinaric-Pindos population). Increasing awareness for key brown bear habitats and corridors, especially in potential ecological traps within cultural landscapes, will be necessary for large carnivore conservation.},

	abstract = {Genomic resources developed for domesticated species provide powerful tools for studying the evolutionary history of their wild relatives. Here we use 61K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly spaced throughout the canine nuclear genome to analyse evolutionary relationships among the three largest European populations of grey wolves in comparison with other populations worldwide, and investigate genome-wide effects of demographic bottlenecks and signatures of selection. European wolves have a discontinuous range, with large and connected populations in Eastern Europe and relatively smaller, isolated populations in Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. Our results suggest a continuous decline in wolf numbers in Europe since the Late Pleistocene, and long-term isolation and bottlenecks in the Italian and Iberian populations following their divergence from the Eastern European population. The Italian and Iberian populations have low genetic variability and high linkage disequilibrium, but relatively few autozygous segments across the genome. This last characteristic clearly distinguishes them from populations that underwent recent drastic demographic declines or founder events, and implies long-term bottlenecks in these two populations. Although genetic drift due to spatial isolation and bottlenecks seems to be a major evolutionary force diversifying the European populations, we detected 35 loci that are putatively under diversifying selection. Two of these loci flank the canine platelet-derived growth factor gene, which affects bone growth and may influence differences in body size between wolf populations. This study demonstrates the power of population genomics for identifying genetic signals of demographic bottlenecks and detecting signatures of directional selection in bottlenecked populations, despite their low background variability.},

	abstract = {European wolf (Canis lupus) populations have suffered extensive decline and range contraction due to anthropogenic culling. In Bulgaria, although wolves are still recovering from a severe demographic bottleneck in the 1970s, hunting is allowed with few constraints. A recent increase in hunting pressure has raised concerns regarding long-term viability. We thus carried out a comprehensive conservation genetic analysis using microsatellite and mtDNA markers. Our results showed high heterozygosity levels (0.654, SE 0.031) and weak genetic bottleneck signals, suggesting good recovery since the 1970s decline. However, we found high levels of inbreeding (F IS = 0.113, SE 0.019) and a N e/N ratio lower than expected for an undisturbed wolf population (0.11, 95 \% CI 0.08–0.29). We also found evidence for hybridisation and introgression from feral dogs (C. familiaris) in 10 out of 92 wolves (9.8 \%). Our results also suggest admixture between wolves and local populations of golden jackals (C. aureus), but less extensive as compared with the admixture with dogs. We detected local population structure that may be explained by fragmentation patterns during the 1970s decline and differences in local ecological characteristics, with more extensive sampling needed to assess further population substructure. We conclude that high levels of inbreeding and hybridisation with other canid species, which likely result from unregulated hunting, may compromise long-term viability of this population despite its current high genetic diversity. The existence of population subdivision warrants an assessment of whether separate management units are needed for different subpopulations. Our study highlights conservation threats for populations with growing numbers but subject to unregulated hunting.},

	abstract = {Introduced predators have been implicated in the decline of many fauna populations around the world and are the main factor responsible for the failure of numerous fauna reintroduction programs. As a result, control of introduced predators is a significant management action implemented in wildlife protection programs, particularly in Australia, New Zealand and on islands. Individual predators are seldom targeted in conservation programs, which usually conduct broad-scale, non-specific predator control based on the assumption that the removal of each individual predator is equally important. In contrast, predator management programs initiated by human-wildlife conflict typically use profiling or specific control techniques to target 'problem' predators. We investigated whether individual domestic cats vary in the magnitude of their predation threat to wildlife by first reviewing published and anecdotal information on incidences where feral cats have had significant impacts on wildlife protection or translocation programs. We concentrated on prey species that were likely to be more challenging to cats based on their size, novelty or behavior. We then used the results from this review to create a profile of cats that were most likely to cause significant problems for challenging prey, and tested this during a translocation of a threatened mammal species. Both the review and translocation suggested that large male cats 3.5. kg or heavier were disproportionally responsible for predation events on challenging prey and possibly implicated in the failure of many protection or reintroduction programs of mammals greater than 1. kg. Some cats within this demographic profile were responsible for multiple prey deaths suggesting that both demography and prior experience may define predators capable of 'catastrophic predation' that threatens prey populations.Current control programs for feral cats and foxes that do not target particular predator profiles may inadvertently avoid controlling individuals most likely to specialize on threatened prey. We call for the application of crime-fighting forensic and aggregate profiling techniques in wildlife protection programs to determine the profile of predators likely to prey on focal wildlife species and to guide the development of control methods that specifically target these individuals.},

	abstract = {Many large carnivore populations exist in human-influenced stochastic environments where availability of natural food sources vary annually and anthropogenic food sources can supplement energetic demands, but at a potential demographic cost due to human-wildlife conflict and subsequent conflict management. Understanding how these competing factors influence a population is complex and difficult to study, but here we demonstrate the utility of using a stochastic projection matrix model and perturbation analysis to gain insight into this problem. We modeled a black bear population subjected to stochastic failures of fruiting and masting species, but with access to garbage in urban environments. We parameratized our model with data from a 6-year study on black bears in Aspen, Colorado and data synthesized from other research studies. Using computer simulation, we investigated the effect that different levels of conflict-bear removal can have on a bear population by comparing a "reference" scenario where bears did not benefit from human food sources or experience conflict-bear removals with two urban scenarios where bears had varying access to human foods, but conflict bears were removed. We used perturbation analyses to evaluate consequences for changing population vital rates and to estimate the impact each vital rate change had on population growth. Simulations were used to identify how much variation in each vital rate influenced variation in the population growth rate. We identified the survival rate of breeding adult females during good natural food years as having the highest elasticity value. We found that the benefit of increased cub production from available human food sources during natural food failure years was quickly negated if management of conflict bears through removal reduced adult female survival. Increasing the frequency of years when natural food production fails resulted in disproportionate impacts from available urban food and conflict-bear removals, where population growth rates in a High Removal scenario declined 1.5 times faster than in the reference scenario. Our findings suggest that for regions where changing climates will increase the frequency of natural food failures, managers may need to utilize non-lethal practices in managing conflict bears and municipalities will need to secure human food sources to reduce the need for conflict-bear removals and potential population declines.},

We used a process, which has proven to provide accurate estimates from a group of experts, to obtain probabilities for the validation of 32 sightings of the Barbary lion. We consider the scenario where experts are simply asked whether a sighting was valid, as well as asking them to score the sighting based on distinguishablity, observer competence, and verifiability. We find that asking experts to provide scores for these three aspects resulted in each sighting being considered more individually, meaning that this new questioning method provides very different estimated probabilities that a sighting is valid, which greatly affects the outcome from an extinction model. We consider linear opinion pooling and logarithm opinion pooling to combine the three scores, and also to combine opinions on each sighting. We find the two methods produce similar outcomes, allowing the user to focus on chosen features of each method, such as satisfying the marginalisation property or being externally Bayesian.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores can either directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, in contrast to North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Białowieża National Park, Poland. Browsing intensity of tree saplings (height class {\textless} 150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50.5\%) where predator presence is highest, than in the remainder of the wolf pack’s home range (58.3\%). Additionally, browsing intensity was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a ʻungulate escape impedimentʼ, increased (within 5-m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems.},

	abstract = {Harvesting wild animals can affect demographic parameters and life history traits of surviving individuals. Most brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations currently experience low levels of hunting. We characterized mortality patterns in a heavily exploited transboundary brown bear population in Slovenia, Central Europe. Overall, 927 brown bears were reported removed from 1998 to 2008. Most (97\%) removals were human caused including removals from hunting (59\% of removals), management removals of problem individuals (18\%), and vehicle collisions (16\%). Median age of bears removed in Slovenia was 2.3 years, and 78\% of bears removed were {\textless}4 years old. Removal was male-biased overall (59\%), mainly due to the high percent (49\%) of young ({\textless}4 years old) males removed during hunting, a possible consequence of sex-related differences in bear behavior and harvest regulations. However, the effect of sexbiased removal was less than expected based on removal data, and it appears a different harvest regimen in neighboring Croatia and sex-biased dispersal of young bears buffered the demographic effects of selective harvest in Slovenia. We also observed that annual proportion of females in harvests increased with harvest intensity. More males were removed among younger classes, whereas females started to dominate above the age of 8 years. About 20\% of the brown bear population was removed annually by legal harvest; this is one of the highest harvest rates reported for this species. © International Association for Bear Research and Management.},

We carried out systematic non-invasive genetic sampling using hair traps on power poles, as part of a capture-mark-recapture study design in order to rigorously estimate abundance and density of the Pindos bear population in Greece. From 2007-2010 we identified 211 and estimated a mean of 182.3 individuals in four sampling areas; bear densities ranged from 10.0 to 54 bears/1000km$^{\textrm{2}}$. These results indicate an important population recovery of this large carnivore in Greece in recent years; a conservative population estimate would place the population size in the entire country {\textgreater}450 individuals. Considering the results of the study and the increased negative interactions between humans and bears recorded currently in Greece, we suggest that systematic genetic monitoring using power poles should continue in order to collect the necessary information that will enable the definition of an effective Action Plan for the long-term conservation of this species.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores (bears Ursus arctos, wolves Canis lupus, lynx Lynx lynx and wolverines Gulo gulo) are among the most challenging group of species to maintain as large and continuous populations or to reintegrate back into the European landscape. Political, socioeconomic and society changes challenge past management approaches in some of the large populations. At the same time local improvements in habitat quality, the return of their prey species, public support and favourable legislation allow for the recovery of some small populations. Several of Europe's large carnivore populations are large and robust, others are expanding, some small populations remain critically endangered and a few are declining. Large carnivores need very large areas and their conservation needs to be planned on very wide spatial scales that will often span many intra- and inter-national borders. Within these large scales conservation and management actions need to be coordinated. To facilitate coordination, a common understanding of the present day conservation status of large carnivores at national and population level is an important basis. The aim of this summary report is to provide an expert based update of the conservation status of all populations identified by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (LCIE). However, methods used to monitor large carnivores vary and a direct comparison over time or among populations will never be possible at a continental scale. It is more realistic to have an insight into the general order of magnitude of the population, its trend and permanent range as the "currencies" for comparisons and assessments. This summary also does not aim to replace the habitat directive reporting, but rather complement it. Discrepancies will likely occur due to different time periods covered and different agreements reached on common reporting criteria on a national level which has to deal with many more species. Furthermore, for several countries the most recent data or distribution map were not always available, yet. Changes in monitoring methods likely result in changing population estimates, even in stable populations. Improved and more costly methods may suddenly discover that previous estimates were too high, or may detect more individuals than previously assumed. Examples of both occur. Being aware of the change in methodology the expert assessment may still be "stable" for the population even if numbers listed in tables have changed. On the other hand, large scale "official" (government) estimates may be based on questionable or non-transparent extrapolations that run contrary to data from reference areas within the country or similar regions from other countries. If the discrepancy is apparent, expert assessment needs to question official numbers.},

Numerical evaluations of exact probability distributions and computer simulations verify that this new estimator yields unbiased estimates also when based on a modest number of alleles and loci. At the cost of a larger standard deviation, it thus eliminates the bias associated with earlier estimators. The new estimator should be particularly useful for microsatellite loci and panels of SNPs, representing a large number of alleles, many of which will occur at low frequencies.},

We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the 'informativeness' of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions.We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs.Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly.These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

Nonetheless, many least-squares statistical tests depend on the variance of the sum of residuals, which by the Central Limit Theorem converge to a Gaussian distribution for large sample sizes. Therefore, least-squares LMs will likely have good performance in assessing the statistical significance of regression coefficients. * Using simulations of count data, I compared GLM approaches for testing whether regression coefficients differ from zero with the traditional approach of applying LMs to transformed data. Simulations assumed that variation among sample populations was either (i) negative binomial or (ii) log-normal Poisson (i.e. log-normal variation among populations that were then sampled by a Poisson distribution). I used the simulated data to conduct tests of the hypotheses that regression coefficients differed from zero; I did not investigate statistical properties of the coefficient estimators, such as bias and precision. * For negative binomial simulations whose assumptions closely matched the GLMs, the GLMs were nonetheless prone to type I errors (false positives) especially when there was more than one predictor (independent) variable. After correcting for type I errors, however, the GLMs provided slightly better statistical power than LMs. For log-normal-Poisson simulations, both a GLMM and the LMs performed well, but under some simulated conditions the GLMs had high type I error rates, a deadly sin for statistical tests. * These results show that, while GLMs have slight advantages in power when they are properly specified, they can lead to badly wrong conclusions about the significance of regression coefficients if they are mis-specified. In contrast, transforming data and applying least-squares linear analyses provide robust statistical tests for significance over a wide range of conditions. Thus, the traditional approach of transforming data and applying LMs is still useful.},

	issn = {15231739},
	abstract = {Controlling the spread of invasive species, pests and pathogens is often logistically limited to interventions that target specific locations at specific points in time. However, in complex, highly-connected systems, such as marine environments connected by ocean currents, populations spread dynamically in both space and time via transient connectivity links. This results in non-deterministic future distributions of species with local populations emerging dynamically and concurrently over a large area. The challenge, therefore, is to choose intervention locations which will maximize the effectiveness of the control efforts. We propose a novel method to manage dynamic species invasions/outbreaks that identifies the intervention locations most likely to curtail population expansion. Critically, at any point during the development of the invasion or outbreak, the method identifies the local intervention that maximises the long-term benefit across the ecosystem. In so doing, the method adaptively selects the intervention targets under dynamically changing circumstances. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method by demonstrating its potential application to controlling the spread of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks across Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. We find that application of our dynamic method results in an 18-fold improvement of management outcomes compared to a random targeting of reefs in putative crown-of-thorns starfish control scenarios. Although we focus on applying the method to reducing the spread of species, it can also be reversed and used to help facilitate the spread of species through networks. For example, the method could be used to select those fragments of habitat that are most likely to rebuild a population if sufficiently well protected. This},

We genotyped 16 microsatellite loci in 166 individuals sampled from the wolf population in Estonia and Latvia that has been under strong and continuous hunting pressure for decades. Our analysis demonstrated that this relatively small wolf population is represented by four genetic groups. We also used a novel methodological approach that uses linear interpolation to statistically test the spatial separation of genetic groups. The new method, which is capable of using program STRUCTURE output, can be applied widely in population genetics to reveal both core areas and areas of low significance for genetic groups. We also used a recently developed spatially explicit individual-based method DResD, and applied it for the first time to microsatellite data, revealing a migration corridor and barriers, and several contact zones.},

We also reiterate our recommendations for practitioners, statisticians and researchers to work together to develop long-term, multi-site experimental research programmes using robust methods to understand the impacts of dingoes on mesopredators. * Synthesis and applications. Incorporating robust methods and appropriate experimental designs is needed to ensure that conservation actions are appropriately focused and are supported with robust results.

	abstract = {Occupancy modeling has been applied to a wide variety of taxa and sampling methods, including bird point counts. A critical assumption of basic occupancy models is that sites are occupied throughout the duration of the study, which is unlikely to be true for typical bird point-count studies. As such, we evaluated the implications of mobile animals on parameter estimates. We simulated the movement and detection of individual birds using an individual-based simulation model. We fit the basic occupancy model to data that represented a range of animal mobility, and determined the bias relative to known parameters used in the simulation. Occupancy depends on the size of the site selected, with smaller sites leading to lower occupancy for a given area and number of individuals present. At low animal density, occupancy scales approximately linearly with the area of sites, but at very high density, occupancy asymptotes at 1.0 across all site sizes. Even small amounts of movement lead to bias in estimates of occupancy and detectability, and the typical size of bird home ranges can lead to highly biased parameters. Moreover, variation in home range size over time or across habitats can lead to varying degrees of bias. Because of the potential for large bias in occupancy estimates, and their sensitivity to behaviors of birds (e.g., home range size), we recommend against applying current occupancy models to bird point-count data.},

	abstract = {Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels—especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour—is essential for making the science predictive. ‘Pattern-oriented modelling’ (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.},

	abstract = {With the internet, a massive amount of information on species abundance can be collected under citizen science programs. However, these data are often difficult to use directly in statistical inference, as the data collection is generally opportunistic under such programs, and the distribution of the sampling effort is often not known. In this paper, we developed a statistical framework to combine such "opportunistic data" with data collected using schemes characterized by a known sampling effort. We illustrated the framework with typical bird datasets from the Aquitaine region, south-western France. We demonstrated that such a framework can provide estimates that are always more precise than the ones obtained from the dataset with a known sampling effort alone. The gain in precision may be considerable if the opportunistic data are abundant. We also show that estimates could be obtained even for species recorded only in the opportunistic scheme. Opportunistic data combined with a relatively small amount of data collected with a known effort may thus provide access to precise estimations of quantitative changes in abundance. This should significantly change the organisation of large scale monitoring schemes, particularly for the rarer species. The framework can be readily used to monitor temporal changes but with more restrictive conditions for monitoring spatial changes. The framework presented in this paper will be improved in the future to allow a more easy application to the estimation of the spatial distribution of a species.},

We document the degree of grizzly bear response to various human developments as a function of multiple interacting variables based on observed median distances to roads, trails and development features in a landscape where human presence is widespread. Female grizzly bears remained further than males from paved roads regardless of habitat quality or time of day. Males were found closer to paved roads when within or adjacent to high quality habitat and during the period of least human activity. The combination of traffic volume and highway configuration, however, overrides a bear's attraction to high quality habitats for high-speed, high-volume, highways. Avoidance of busy transportation corridors was strongest in the adult segment of the population. Bears were found closer to trails during the human inactive period when within high quality habitat and further from trails when distant to high quality habitat. Our data indicated an inverse relationship between the sexes in response to vehicles and traffic noise compared to the response to human settlement and encountering people. Female bears were found further away than males in relation to vehicles and traffic noise, yet found closer than males to human settlement and places where people may be encountered. Those males that were more willing to exploit high quality habitat near roads, did so at night and where hiding cover was present. Adult females were the most risk-averse cohort, choosing to avoid humans instead of seeking out high quality habitats. Adult female grizzly bears were influenced most by human activities and development. Management agencies must maintain access to high quality habitat, especially for adult females, and create new opportunities to support the reproductive potential of the population. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Mating with close kin can lead to inbreeding depression through the expression of recessive deleterious alleles and loss of heterozygosity. Mate selection may be affected by kin encounter rate, and inbreeding avoidance may not be uniform but associated with age and social system. Specifically, selection for kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance may be more developed in species that live in family groups or breed cooperatively. To test this hypothesis, we compared kin encounter rate and the proportion of related breeding pairs in noninbred and highly inbred canid populations. The chance of randomly encountering a full sib ranged between 1-8\% and 20-22\% in noninbred and inbred canid populations, respectively. We show that regardless of encounter rate, outside natal groups mates were selected independent of relatedness. Within natal groups, there was a significant avoidance of mating with a relative. Lack of discrimination against mating with close relatives outside packs suggests that the rate of inbreeding in canids is related to the proximity of close relatives, which could explain the high degree of inbreeding depression observed in some populations. The idea that kin encounter rate and social organization can explain the lack of inbreeding avoidance in some species is intriguing and may have implications for the management of populations at risk.},

We also present a novel Independent Metropolis-Hastings sampler which allows for efficient updating of the hyper-parameters which cannot be updated using Gibbs sampling. We tested the model using simulation studies and applied the model to mark-resight data of North Atlantic humpback whales observed in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary where heterogeneity is present in both sighting probability and site preference. Simulation studies show asymptotic convergence of the posterior distribution for each of the hyper-parameters to true parameter values. In application to humpback whales individual heterogeneity is evident in sighting probability and propensity to use the marine sanctuary.},

Simulation studies demonstrated accurate estimation of multiple groups of latent individual heterogeneity. Simulations were also used to identify the limits of the Dirichlet process. The ability of the Dirichlet process to pick up unimodal heterogeneity was explored in order to avoid potential spurious multimodality. In application to a subset of the data from the North Atlantic humpback whales we were able to estimate annual population-level variation in usage of the marine sanctuary and three measures of individual-level variation.

	abstract = {The statistical analysis of mark-recapture-recovery (MRR) data dates back to the 1960s, when the foundation was laid for stochastic models, fitted to data by the method of maximum likelihood. There have been a number of developments which have proved to be extremely influential. Two of these are: the extension of MRR data and modelling to multi-site inference, and the integrated modelling of single-site MRR and census data. The aim of this study is to unite these two independent research programs, in order to enable effective integrated analysis of multi-site MRR data and multi-site census data. Census data can be described by a state-space model, and the likelihood is formed using the Kalman filter. By making use of movement information provided by MRR data, it is possible to avoid flat likelihood surfaces, thus allowing estimation of site-dependent parameters. This increases the precision of dispersal parameters and allows estimation of parameters inestimable from MRR studies alone. This paper extends research within the area of integrated population analysis by developing methods for analysing multi-site census data coupled with multi-site capture recapture data. The methodology is explored using a simulated data set, the structure of which is motivated by a dataset of Great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis).},

	abstract = {The size of animal home ranges often varies inversely with population density among populations of a species. This fact has implications for population monitoring using spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models, in which both the scale of home-range movements σ and population density D usually appear as parameters, and both may vary among populations. It will often be appropriate to model a structural relationship between population-specific values of these parameters, rather than to assume independence. We suggest re-parameterizing the SECR model using kp = σp √Dp, where kp relates to the degree of overlap between home ranges and the subscript p distinguishes populations. We observe that kp is often nearly constant for populations spanning a range of densities. This justifies fitting a model in which the separate kp are replaced by the single parameter k and σp is a density-dependent derived parameter. Continuous density-dependent spatial variation in σ may also be modelled, using a scaled non-Euclidean distance between detectors and the locations of animals. We illustrate these methods with data from automatic photography of tigers Panthera tigris across India, in which the variation is among populations, from mist-netting of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla in Maryland, USA, in which the variation is within a single population over time, and from live-trapping of brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula in New Zealand, modelling spatial variation within one population. Possible applications and limitations of the methods are discussed. A model in which kp is constant, while density varies, provides a parsimonious null model for SECR. The parameter k of the null model is a concise summary of the empirical relationship between home-range size and density that is useful in comparative studies. We expect deviations from this model, particularly the dependence of kp on covariates, to be biologically interesting.},

	abstract = {Background: Improvements in telemetry technology are allowing us to monitor animal movements with increasing accuracy, precision and frequency. The increased complexity of the data collections, however, demands additional software and programming skills to process, store and disseminate the datasets. Recent focus on data availability has also heightened the need for sustainable data management solutions to ensure data integrity and provide longer term access. In the last ten years, a number of online facilities have been developed for the archiving, processing and sharing of telemetry data. These facilities offer secure storage, multi-user support and analysis tools and are a step along the way to improving data access, long-term data preservation and science communication. While these software platforms promote data sharing, access to the majority of the data and to the software behind these systems remains restricted. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, highly accessible and fully transparent software facility for animal movement data. Results: The online system we developed (http://oztrack.org) offers a set of robust, up-to-date and accessible tools for managing, processing, visualising and analysing animal location data and linking these outputs with environmental datasets. As OzTrack uses exclusively free and open-source software, and the source code is available online, the system promotes open access not only to data but also to the tools and software underpinning the system. Conclusions: We outline the capabilities and limitations of the infrastructure design and discuss the uptake of this platform by the Australasian biotelemetry community. We discuss whether an open approach to analysis tools and software encourages a more open approach to sharing data, information and knowledge. Finally, we discuss why a free and open approach enhances longer term sustainability and enables data storage facilities to evolve in parallel with the telemetry devices themselves.},

	abstract = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Monitoring the loss of genetic diversity in wild populations after a bottleneck event is a priority in conservation and management plans. Here, we used diverse molecular markers to search for signatures of demographic bottlenecks in two wolf populations; an isolated population from the Iberian Peninsula and a non-isolated population from European Russia. Autosomal, mtDNA and Y-chromosomal diversity and the effective population size (N e) were significantly lower in the Iberian population. Neutrality tests using mtDNA sequences, such as R 2, Fu and Li's F, Tajima's D and Fu's F s, were positively significant in the Iberian population, suggesting a population decline, but were not significant for the Russian population, likely due to its larger effective population size. However, three tests using autosomal data confirmed the occurrence of the genetic bottleneck in both populations. The M-ratio test was the only one providing significant results for both populations. Given the lack of consistency among the different tests, we recommend using multiple approaches to investigate possible past bottlenecks. The small effective population size (about 50) in the Iberian Peninsula compared to the presumed extant population size could indicate that the bottleneck was more powerful than initially suspected or an overestimation of the current population. The risks associated with small effective population sizes suggest that the genetic change in this population should be closely monitored in the future. On the other hand, the relatively small effective population size for Russian wolves (a few hundred individuals) could indicate some fragmentation, contrary to what is commonly assumed. 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Here, we propose a new estimator for estimating abundance of mobile populations using telemetry and counts of unmarked animals. The estimator assumes that the target population conforms to a fission-fusion grouping pattern, in which the population is divided into groups that frequently change in size and composition. If assumptions are met, it is not necessary to locate all groups in the population to estimate abundance.

	abstract = {Accurate and precise estimates of population size are critical for effective management but can be particularly difficult to achieve for small populations of large carnivores. We approached this challenge by integrating multiple noninvasive data sources into a DNA-based mark–recapture framework to estimate the abundance of the small and endangered Apennine brown bear population. To improve sample size and coverage, we collected hair samples from June to September 2011 by concurrently using 4 noninvasive sampling methods: intensive hair-snagging (forty-three 5×5-km cells and five 12-day sampling sessions) plus secondary sampling methods (bear rub trees, alpine buckthorn aggregations, and incidental sampling). Following marker selection based on tissue samples from 55 Apennine bears, we used 13 microsatellites (plus gender) and quality assurance protocols to identify multilocus genotypes from hair samples. We used Huggins closed models in program MARK to estimate population size, which allowed us to account for spatial, temporal, and demographic components of heterogeneity in secondary sampling methods. Based on 529 analyzed hair samples, 80.5\% of which yielded high-confidence scores for all markers, we achieved a rather precise ( CV = 7.9\%) population estimate of 51 bears (95\% CI = 47–66) including cubs. Compared to a previous survey in 2008, our results provide evidence that the Apennine brown bear population has not been declining in recent years. Additionally, the relatively high (closure corrected) density (39.7 bears/1,000 km2; 95\% CI = 36.6–51.4) indicates that habitat productivity within the core range is currently adequate for bears and that effective conservation of this small bear population should aim to expand the bears’ range across a larger portion of the central Apennines. We examined if a reduction in sampling effort would affect the precision of our population estimates. Reduced sample coverage, small sample size, and low hair-trap-capture probability preclude the adoption of a single sampling method or a subset of such to survey small bear populations if a comparable level of precision is required.},

We compare 10 modeling techniques in terms of predictive power and sensitivity to location error, change in map resolution, and sample size, and assess whether some species traits can explain variation in model performance. We focused on 30 native tree species in Switzerland and used presence-only data to model current distribution, which we evaluated against independent presence–absence data. While there are important differences between the predictive performance of modeling methods, the variance in model performance is greater among species than among techniques. Within the range of data perturbations in this study, some extrinsic parameters of data affect model performance more than others: location error and sample size reduced performance of many techniques, whereas grain had little effect on most techniques. No technique can rescue species that are difficult to predict. The predictive power of species-distribution models can partly be predicted from a series of species characteristics and traits based on growth rate, elevational distribution range, and maximum elevation. Slow-growing species or species with narrow and specialized niches tend to be better modeled. The Swiss presence-only tree data produce models that are reliable enough to be useful in planning and management applications.

This paper identifies the potential changes in the future distribution of species under the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios, in order that such changes can be taken into account in conservation management. Location The model was applied to Britain and Ireland. Methods A model based on an artificial neural network was used to predict the changing bioclimate envelopes of species in Britain and Ireland. Fifty-four species representing 15 habitats were modelled. Results The modelled species could be placed into three categories: those losing suitable climate space, those gaining it, and those showing little or no change. When the species were associated with habitats it was found that Arctic-Alpine/montane heath communities were the most sensitive to climate change, followed by pine woodland and beech woodland in southern England. In lowland heath, wet heath, cereal field margins, coastal grazing marsh, drought-prone acid grassland and calcareous grassland, the species either showed little change or an increase in suitable climate space. The other eight habitats showed a mixed response. Conclusions The species show a variety of responses to climate change and thus their current habitat associations may alter. The uncertain future of some species and habitats is highlighted. Conservation policy and practice will need to be revised in the face of climate change.},

	abstract = {Advances in remotely sensed data for characterizing habitat have enabled development of spatially explicit predictive species distribution models (SDM) that can be essential tools for management. SDMs commonly use coarse-grain metrics, such as forest patch size or patch connectivity, over broad spatial extents. However, species distributions are likely driven in part by local, fine-grained habitat conditions. Conservation and management are often planned and applied locally, where coarse predictions may be uninformative or not sufficiently precise.We investigated the integration of high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with avian point sampling data to develop a detection-corrected occupancy model to quantify habitat-occurrence relationships for two species with different habitats: the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) on a military installation in central Texas.We compared occupancy models that used only the more conventional, coarse remotely sensed metrics to models that also incorporated high-resolution LiDAR-derived metrics for vegetation height and canopy cover, to assess their use for predicting distributions. Models including LiDAR-derived vegetation height and canopy cover metrics were competitive for both species, and models without LiDAR-derived vegetation height had substantially lower model weights and explanatory strength. Area under curve estimates for the highest ranked models were high for warblers (0.864) and moderate for vireos (0.746). Using the best supported models for each species, we predicted the occurrence distribution for both species. The resulting predictions provide a decision support tool that enables assessment of the status, impacts, and mitigation of impacts to endangered species habitat on the installation due to land management and military training activities that is more standardized and accurate than current assessment approaches based on visual gestalt of habitat and expert opinion. Additionally, although previous species distribution models have been created for our focal species, most fail to match the grain and extent of most management actions or include local, fine-grained metrics that influence distributions. In contrast, we demonstrate that use of LiDAR with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution at a scale that is relevant ecologically and to the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.

As they reach these areas, the predators often encounter unwary livestock and unprepared keepers, which translates into large economic costs. The cost per individual may have important repercussions on the conservation and management of large predators. During the years 2003–2004, we collected 136 feces preliminarily identified as belonging to gray wolves Canis lupus along the north-eastern limit of the wolf range in the Iberia peninsula (Basque Country, Spain). Genetic analyses allowed us to identify the species of origin in 86 cases: 31 corresponded to wolves, two to red foxes Vulpes vulpes and 53 to dogs Canis familiaris. Among the wolves, we identified 16 different individuals. We estimated the cost of conserving wolves to be {\textgreater}€3000 per wolf per year, based on the cost of damage compensation and prevention during the 2003–2004 period. However, most of the wolf feces contained wild prey whereas dog feces contained mostly remains of domestic animals. This finding suggests that uncontrolled dogs could be responsible for some of the attacks on livestock, contributing to negative public attitudes toward wolf conservation and increasing its cost.},

	abstract = {Wildlife management often hinges upon an accurate assessment of population density. Although undeniably useful, many of the traditional approaches to density estimation such as visual counts, livetrapping, or mark–recapture suffer from a suite of methodological and analytical weaknesses. Rare, secretive, or highly mobile species exacerbate these problems through the reality of small sample sizes and movement on and off study sites. In response to these difficulties, there is growing interest in the use of non- invasive survey techniques, which provide the opportunity to collect larger samples with minimal increases in effort, as well as the application of analytical frameworks that are not reliant on large sample size arguments. One promising survey technique, the use of scat detecting dogs, offers a greatly enhanced probability of detection while at the same time generating new difficulties with respect to non-standard survey routes, variable search intensity, and the lack of a fixed survey point for characterizing non-detection. In order to account for these issues, we modified an existing spatially explicit, capture–recapture model for camera trap data to account for variable search intensity and the lack of fixed, georeferenced trap locations. We applied this modified model to a fisher (Martes pennanti) dataset from the Sierra National Forest, California, and compared the results (12.3 fishers/100 km2) tomore traditional density estimates.We then evaluatedmodel performance using simulations at 3 levels of population density. Simulation results indicated that estimates based on the posterior mode were relatively unbiased. We believe that this approach provides a flexible analytical framework for reconciling the inconsistencies between detector dog survey data and density estimation procedures.},

	abstract = {Population dynamics with regard to evolution of traits has typically been studied using matrix projection models (MPMs). Recently, to work with continuous traits, integral projection models (IPMs) have been proposed. Imitating the path with MPMs, IPMs are handled first with a fitting stage, then with a projection stage. Fitting these models has so far been done only with individual-level transition data. These data are used to estimate the demographic functions (survival, growth, fecundity) that comprise the kernel of the IPM specification. Then, the estimated kernel is iterated from an initial trait distribution to project steady state population behavior under this kernel. When trait distributions are observed over time, such an approach does not align projected distributions with these observed temporal benchmarks. The contribution here, focusing on size distributions, is to address this issue. Our concern is that the above approach introduces an inherent mismatch in scales. The redistribution kernel in the IPM proposes a mechanistic description of population level redistribution. A kernel of the same functional form, fitted to data at the individual level, would provide a mechanistic model for individual-level processes. Resulting parameter estimates and the associated estimated kernel are at the wrong scale and do not allow population-level interpretation. Our approach views the observed size distribution at a given time as a point pattern over a bounded interval. We build a three-stage hierarchical model to infer about the dynamic intensities used to explain the observed point patterns. This model is driven by a latent deterministic IPM and we introduce uncertainty by having the operating IPM vary around this deterministic specification. Further uncertainty arises in the realization of the point pattern given the operating IPM. Fitted within a Bayesian framework, such modeling enables full inference about all features of the model. Such dynamic modeling, optimized by fitting data observed over time, is better suited to projection. Exact Bayesian model fitting is very computationally challenging; we offer approximate strategies to facilitate computation. We illustrate with simulated data examples as well as well as a set of annual tree growth data from Duke Forest in North Carolina. A further example shows the benefit of our approach, in terms of projection, compared with the foregoing individual level fitting.},

During the study, two jackals were killed by car and we collected tissue samples for potential future genetic analysis. Official records of depredations showed high increase in assumed jackal attacks on sheep, but we could not confirm if or how many of these depredations were actually caused by jackals.

	abstract = {Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21 000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM dN1. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but indivN1ual modeling approaches should be valN1ated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study},

	abstract = {Habitat suitability maps are very useful for planning management and conservation priorities. Epistemic uncertainty usually is an intrinsic part of the mapping process and yet, subjective uncertainties have rarely been addressed. Subjective uncertainty arises from subjective judgments, generally by experts, on how to interpret data and translate them into a model. This study examines how to encapsulate subjective uncertainty in a pair of 'bounding' habitat suitability maps. These maps represent extremes of the range of plausible maps obtained from alternative ways to model habitat suitability. Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) was used to illustrate the process within the spatial context of the alpine areas of Victoria in southern Australia. Four habitat variables (presence of forest, distance to forest edge, presence of gullies, and amount of solar radiation) and three models were retained. A total of 22 equally plausible habitat suitability maps were compared with three different statistics (sum of suitability index, connectance and least-cost distance) to obtain bounding maps, each of them linked to a potential application of habitat suitability maps for this species. The three statistics gave different results, emphasizing the importance of considering how habitat suitability maps are used in subsequent analyses. Very large bounds were found when estimating Sambar population size through the sum of suitability values. With the connectance index, different pairs of bounding maps were found when the Alpine area or the State as a whole was considered. Using least-cost distances, we found that the uncertainty surrounding the choice of the suitability model was much more important than the uncertainty surrounding the ways of computing the habitat variables. Subjective uncertainty can be effectively propagated into subsequent analyses through the use of bounding habitat suitability maps, if the potential use of the maps in subsequent analysis is known. The importance of subjective uncertainties could therefore be assessed and decision-making in conservation ecology would be better informed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implica- tions for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed.

	abstract = {Abstract Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

	abstract = {* The recent expansion of continuous-resighting telemetry methods (e.g. acoustic receivers, PIT tag antennae) has created a class of ecological data not well suited for traditional mark–recapture statistics. Estimating survival when continuous recapture data is available ensues a practical problem, because classical capture–recapture models were derived under a discrete sampling scheme that assumes sampling events are instantaneous with respect to the interval between events. * To investigate the use of continuous data in survival analysis, we conducted a model structure adequacy simulation that tested the Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) and Barker joint data survival estimation models, which mainly differ through the Barker's inclusion of secondary period information. We simulated a population in which survival and detection occurred as a near continuous (daily) process and collapsed detection information into monthly sampling bins for survival estimation. * While both models performed well when survival was time-independent, the CJS was substantially biased for low survival values and time-dependent conditions. Additionally, unlike the CJS, the Barker model consistently performed well over multiple sample sizes (number of marked individuals). However, the high number of parameters in the Barker model led to convergence difficulties, resulting in a need for an alternative optimization method (simulated annealing). * We recommend the use of the Barker model when using continuous data for survival analysis, because it outperformed the CJS over a biologically reasonable range of potential parameter values. However, the practical difficulty of implementing the Barker model combined with its shortcomings during two simulations leaves room for the specification of novel statistical methods tailored specifically for continuous mark–resighting data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Although fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children's neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVE We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to investigate the effects of increased fluoride exposure and delayed neurobehavioral development. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Water Resources Abstracts, and TOXNET databases through 2011 for eligible studies. We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, because many studies on fluoride neurotoxicity have been published in Chinese journals only. In total, we identified 27 eligible epidemiological studies with high and reference exposures, end points of IQ scores, or related cognitive function measures with means and variances for the two exposure groups. Using random-effects models, we estimated the standardized mean difference between exposed and reference groups across all studies. We conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to studies using the same outcome assessment and having drinking-water fluoride as the only exposure. We performed the Cochran test for heterogeneity between studies, Begg's funnel plot, and Egger test to assess publication bias, and conducted meta-regressions to explore sources of variation in mean differences among the studies. RESULTS The standardized weighted mean difference in IQ score between exposed and reference populations was -0.45 (95\% confidence interval: -0.56, -0.35) using a random-effects model. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses also indicated inverse associations, although the substantial heterogeneity did not appear to decrease. CONCLUSIONS The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children's neurodevelopment. Future research should include detailed individual-level information on prenatal exposure, neurobehavioral performance, and covariates for adjustment.},

	abstract = {Logistic regression is an important tool for wildlife habitat-selection studies, but the method frequently has been misapplied due to an inadequate understanding of the logistic model, its interpretation, and the influence of sampling design. To promote better use of this method, we review its application and interpretation under 3 sampling designs: random, case-control, and use-availability. Logistic regression is appropriate for habitat use-nonuse studies employing random sampling and can be used to directly model the conditional probability of use in such cases. Logistic regression also is appropriate for studies employing case-control sampling designs, but careful attention is required to interpret results correctly. Unless bias can be estimated or probability of use is small for all habitats, results of case-control studies should be interpreted as odds ratios, rather than probability of use or relative probability of use. When data are gathered under a use-availability design, logistic regression can be used to estimate approximate odds ratios if probability of use is small, at least on average. More generally, however, logistic regression is inappropriate for modeling habitat selection in use-availability studies. In particular, using logistic regression to fit the exponential model of Manly et al. (2002:100) does not guarantee maximum-likelihood estimates, valid probabilities, or valid likelihoods. We show that the resource selection function (RSF) commonly used for the exponential model is proportional to a logistic discriminant function. Thus, it may be used to rank habitats with respect to probability of use and to identify important habitat characteristics or their surrogates, but it is not guaranteed to be proportional to probability of use. Other problems associated with the exponential model also are discussed. We describe an alternative model based on Lancaster and Imbens (1996) that offers a method for estimating conditional probability of use in use-availability studies. Although promising, this model fails to converge to a unique solution in some important situations. Further work is needed to obtain a robust method that is broadly applicable to use-availability studies.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the characteristics of regression-kriging (RK), its strengths and limitations, and illustrates these with a simple example and three case studies. RK is a spatial interpolation technique that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called "Universal Kriging" (UK) and "Kriging with External Drift" (KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing and interpretation of results are illustrated with three case studies covering the national territory of Croatia. The case studies use land surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors. These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature) and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues: implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments, both statistical and GIS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The main reason for the lack of success of AES is considered to be their low ecological quality and insufficient area. Understanding the effects of different management strategies on the ecological quality of AES is therefore important. Here, we investigate the relationship between breeding bird density and species richness and the age of sown field margins, a widely used type of AES, in southwestern Switzerland. Territories of breeding birds were mapped on 67 field margins between 2004 and 2011. Territory densities (for eight species) and species richness were analysed in relation to age of the field margin. A general negative correlation between size of the field margin and territory density indicated that territory density was higher when the birds could forage in adjacent cultivated land. Territory densities and species richness increased up to an age of 4–6 years after sowing, depending on the species, and declined thereafter. The results suggest that the co-occurrence of newly sown margins and margins over 3 years old will have a positive effect on breeding bird densities and species diversity.},

Simulation studies demonstrated that parameter estimators are unbiased when temporary emigration is either ‘‘completely random’’ or is determined by the size and location of home ranges relative to survey points. We also applied the model to repeated removal sampling data collected on Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvancia) in the White Mountain National Forest, USA. The density estimate from our model, 1.09 birds/ha, was similar to an estimate of 1.11 birds/ha produced by an intensive spot-mapping effort. Our model is also applicable when processes other than temporary emigration affect the probability of being available for detection, such as in studies using cue counts.

The selection of such localities may influence model parameterization and thus, can influence the appropriateness and accuracy of the model prediction when extrapolating the species distribution across time and space. We used 12 species from the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT) to evaluate the relationship between the geographic extent from which pseudo-absences are taken and model performance, and shape and importance of predictor variables using the MAXENT modeling method. Model performance is lower when pseudo-absence points are taken from either a restricted or broad region with respect to species occurrence data than from an intermediate region. Furthermore, variable importance (i.e., contribution to the model) changed such that, models became increasingly simplified, dominated by just two variables, as the area from which pseudo-absence points were drawn increased. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the spatial extent from which pseudo-absence data are taken. We suggest species distribution modeling exercises should begin with exploratory analyses evaluating what extent might provide both the most accurate results and biologically meaningful fit between species occurrence and predictor variables.

We then used habitat associations in the Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary and the Rasmussen Lowlands, Nunavut, Canada, in models to predict distributions of focal species in each study area. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric to evaluate predictive accuracy (hereafter, quality) of models. In the Queen Maud Gulf, AUC values suggested reasonable model discrimination for white-fronted geese, Canada geese, and tundra swans (i.e., AUC \&gt; 0.7). Quality of species-habitat models for king eiders and long-tailed ducks was less than other species considered, but these models still predicted encounters and non-encounters significantly better than the null model. For all species, quality of species-habitat models was lesser for the Rasmussen Lowlands than for the Queen Maud Gulf, although discrimination ability for Rasmussen Lowland distributions remained significantly better than corresponding null models for geese and swans, but not for seaducks.

Hence, deviations from proportionality between use and availability are considered the tell-tale sign of preference. This principle forms the basis for most habitat selection and species distribution models fitted to use-availability or count data (e.g. MaxEnt and Resource Selection Functions). Yet, once an essential habitat type is sufficiently abundant to meet an individual's needs, increased availability of this habitat type may lead to a decrease in the use/availability ratio. Accordingly, habitat selection functions may estimate negative coefficients when habitats are superabundant, incorrectly suggesting an apparent avoidance. Furthermore, not accounting for the effects of availability on habitat use may lead to poor predictions, particularly when applied to habitats that differ considerably from those for which data have been collected. Using simulations, we show that habitat use varies non-linearly with habitat availability, even when individuals follow simple movement rules to acquire food and avoid risk. The results show that the impact of availability strongly depends on the type of habitat (e.g. whether it is essential or substitutable) and how it interacts with the distribution and availability of other habitats. We demonstrate the utility of a variety of existing and new methods that enable the influence of habitat availability to be explicitly estimated. Models that allow for non-linear effects (using b-spline smoothers) and interactions between environmental covariates defining habitats and measures of their availability were best able to capture simulated patterns of habitat use across a range of environments. An appealing aspect of some of the methods we discuss is that the relative influence of availability is not defined a priori, but directly estimated by the model. This feature is likely to improve model prediction, hint at the mechanism of habitat selection, and may signpost habitats that are critical for the organism's fitness.},

	abstract = {Reintroduction can be necessary for recovering populations of threatened species. However, the success of reintroduction efforts has been poorer than many biologists and managers would hope. To increase the benefits gained from reintroduction, management decision making should be couched within formal decision-analytic frameworks. Decision analysis is a structured process for informing decision making that recognizes that all decisions have a set of components—objectives, alternative management actions, predictive models, and optimization methods—that can be decomposed, analyzed, and recomposed to facilitate optimal, transparent decisions. Because the outcome of interest in reintroduction efforts is typically population viability or related metrics, models used in decision analysis efforts for reintroductions will need to include population models. In this special section of the Journal of Wildlife Management, we highlight examples of the construction and use of models for informing management decisions in reintroduced populations. In this introductory contribution, we review concepts in decision analysis, population modeling for analysis of decisions in reintroduction settings, and future directions. Increased use of formal decision analysis, including adaptive management, has great potential to inform reintroduction efforts. Adopting these practices will require close collaboration among managers, decision analysts, population modelers, and field biologists. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

We examined occupancy dynamics and habitat use of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, in shallow lake environments over a summer and early fall season in the Knik River area of south central Alaska using models which control for and estimate sampling gear detection efficiency. In addition, we present statements for the probability that observed absences at a survey site or from a survey area (a collection of sites) are true absences given some amount of sampling effort and analysts' beliefs about site occupancy and sampling gear detection efficiency which can be used to guide inventory and monitoring efforts for juvenile salmon or other wildlife and plant species. Occupancy modelling results demonstrate that minnow traps were effective at sampling juvenile coho in shallow lake environments, with a mean probability of detection across the study period of 0.68 (i.e., probability of detecting the presence of juvenile coho given that they are present at a trap site; SE = 0.03). Juvenile coho salmon migrated into shallow water lakes in late summer and early fall, presumably to seek out overwinter habitat. N-mixture modelling examination of habitat use demonstrated that once in shallow lake environments, juvenile coho were widely distributed across a range of microhabitats, with some evidence for preference for shallower depths and warmer water temperatures.},

While optimized commercial genotyping kits have been developed for humans and domestic animals, such protocols are rare in wildlife research. We developed a highly optimized multiplex PCR that genotypes 12 microsatellite loci and a sex determination locus in brown bear (Ursus arctos) faecal samples in a single multiplex PCR and a single sequencer run. We used this protocol to genotype 1053 faecal samples of bears from the Dinaric population, and obtained useful genotypes for 88\% of the samples, a very high success rate. The new protocol outperformed the multiplex pre-amplification strategy used in a previous study of 473 faecal samples with a 78.4\% success rate. On a subset of 182 samples we directly compared the performance of both approaches, and found no advantage of the multiplex pre-amplification. While pre-amplification protocols might still improve PCR success and reliability on a small fraction of low-quality samples, the higher costs and workload do not justify their use when analysing reasonably fresh non-invasive material. Moreover, the high number of multiplexed loci in the new protocol makes it comparable to commercially developed genotyping kits developed for domestic animals and humans.},

Classically, count data follow a Poisson distribution; however, in practice such data often display greater heterogeneity in the form of excess zeros (zero-inflation) or greater spread in the values (overdispersion) or both.

	abstract = {There is limited information available on changes in biodiversity at the European scale, because there is a lack of data from standardised monitoring for most species groups. However, a great number of observations made without a standardised field protocol is available in many countries for many species. Such opportunistic data offer an alternative source of information, but unfortunately such data suffer from non-standardised observation effort and geographical bias. Here we describe a new approach to compiling supranational trends using opportunistic data which adjusts for these two major imperfections. The non-standardised observation effort is dealt with by occupancy modelling, and the unequal geographical distribution of sites by a weighting procedure. The damselfly Calopteryx splendens was chosen as our test species. The data were collected from five countries (Ireland, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and France), covering the period 1990–2008. We used occupancy models to estimate the annual number of occupied 1 x 1 km sites per country. Occupancy models use presence-absence data, account for imperfect detection of species, and thereby correct for between-year variability in observation effort. The occupancy models were run per country in a Bayesian mode of inference using JAGS. The occupancy estimates per country were then aggregated to assess the supranational trend in the number of occupied 1 x 1 km2. To adjust for the unequal geographical distribution of surveyed sites, we weighted the countries according to the number of sites surveyed and the range of the species per country. The distribution of C. splendens has increased significantly in the combined five countries. Our trial demonstrated that a supranational trend in distribution can be derived from opportunistic data, while adjusting for observation effort and geographical bias. This opens new perspectives for international monitoring of biodiversity.},

Until now, the existence of competition (including predation) between these groups has not been tested. To assess the coexistence and potential role of interspecific interactions between surface Gam- marus fossarum and subterranean Niphargus timavi, and to de- termine their micro distributions, we conducted a series of field and laboratory observations. We aimed to determine: (1) species substrate preference, (2) whether the presence of G. fossarum influences the habitat choice of N. timavi, and (3) possible preda- tion effects on micro habitat choice of small juveniles. Through- out a small river in SW Slovenia, N. timavi was predominantly found in leaf litter and gravel, but rarely in sand. In the sand however, we exclusively found juveniles. In contrast, surface G. fossarum sheltered mainly in leaf litter. A similar, body size de- pendent, micro distribution was observed in G. fossarum, where small individuals were generally found in gravel and sand. The presence of G. fossarum affected the micro distribution of juve- nile, but not adult, N. timavi. In the laboratory we observed pre- dation and cannibalism in both species. Niphargus timavi, how- ever, appeared to be a more efficient predator than G. fossarum. In particular, juvenile N. timavi were most vulnerable to preying by adults of both species. This probably affected the distribution of juvenile N. timavi that chose finer substrates when placed with adult individuals in an aquarium with granules of different size. To understand the distribution of subterranean species, the summed effect of intraspecific interactions, as well as surface – subterranean species interactions, in particular between indi- viduals of different size, should be taken into account.},

The flaw in this approach is that distributions of species also reflect the influence of interactions with other species(7-10), so predictions based on climate envelopes may be very misleading if the interactions between species are altered by climate change(11). An additional problem is that current distributions may be the result of sources and sinks(12), in which species appear to thrive in places where they really persist only because individuals disperse into them from elsewhere(13,14). Here we use microcosm experiments on simple but realistic assemblages to show how misleading the climate envelope approach can be. We show that dispersal and interactions, which are important elements of population dynamics(15), must be included in predictions of biotic responses to climate change.},

Validation was needed due to recent modifications made to the model, and because the model had not been formally tested outside of New York State. Prior to validation, procedures to estimate the starting time of the epidemic, the amount of initial inoculum, and leaf wetness duration were developed. Observed data for validation were from field trials with three potato cultivars in the Peruvian locations of Comas and Huancayo in the department of Junín, and Oxapampa in the department of Pasco in 1999 and 2000 for a total of 12 epidemics. These data had not been used previously for estimating model parameters. Observed and simulated epidemics were compared graphically using disease progress curves and numerically using the area under the disease progress curve in a confidence interval test, an equivalence test, and an envelope of acceptance test. The level of agreement between observed and simulated epidemics was high, and the model was found to be valid according to subjective and objective performance criteria. The approach of measuring fitness components of potato cultivars infected with isolates of a certain clonal lineage of P. infestans under controlled conditions and then using the experimental results as parameters of LATEBLIGHT proved to be effective. Fungicide treatments were not considered in this study.},

	abstract = {The impact of the ongoing rapid climate change on natural systems is a major issue for human societies. An important challenge for ecologists is to identify the climatic factors that drive temporal variation in demographic parameters, and, ultimately, the dynamics of natural populations. The analysis of long-term monitoring data at the individual scale is often the only available approach to estimate reliably demographic parameters of vertebrate populations. We review statistical procedures used in these analyses to study links between climatic factors and survival variation in vertebrate populations.We evaluated the efficiency of various statistical procedures from an analysis of survival in a population of white stork, Ciconia ciconia, a simulation study and a critical review of 78 papers published in the ecological literature. We identified six potential methodological problems: (i) the use of statistical models that are not well-suited to the analysis of long-term monitoring data collected at the individual scale; (ii) low ratios of number of statistical units to number of candidate climatic covariates; (iii) collinearity among candidate climatic covariates; (iv) the use of statistics, to assess statistical support for climatic covariates effects, that deal poorly with unexplained variation in survival; (v) spurious detection of effects due to the co-occurrence of trends in survival and the climatic covariate time series; and (vi) assessment of the magnitude of climatic effects on survival using measures that cannot be compared across case studies. The critical review of the ecological literature revealed that five of these six methodological problems were often poorly tackled. As a consequence we concluded that many of these studies generated hypotheses but only few provided solid evidence for impacts of climatic factors on survival or reliable measures of the magnitude of such impacts.We provide practical advice to solve efficiently most of the methodological problems identified. The only frequent issue that still lacks a straightforward solution was the low ratio of the number of statistical units to the number of candidate climatic covariates. In the perspective of increasing this ratio and therefore of producing more robust analyses of the links between climate and demography, we suggest leads to improve the procedures for designing field protocols and selecting a set of candidate climatic covariates. Finally, we present recent statistical methods with potential interest for assessing the impact of climatic factors on demographic parameters.},

We examined possible factors causing missed fixes in GPS collars on sympatric free-ranging Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolverines (Gulo gulo) in northern Sweden. We tested for effects of species, activity, habitat, individual, and collar on fix rate. Species was the most important factor affecting fix rate. Fix rate of GPS collars on lynx (80) was almost twice as high as on wolverines (46). Fix rate decreased during periods of low activity (day beds) for both species. Fix rate also decreased for females (both lynx and wolverine) for a period after they gave birth. We found no effect of proportion of forest within individual home range on fix rate. We conclude that species behavior, characteristics, and activity pattern are important factors affecting fix rate that we recommend be taken into consideration prior to analyzing GPS location data. © The Wildlife Society.},

The present study analyses the degree and limits of thermal specialisation in various populations of a key species of the intertidal zone, the lugworm Arenicola marina, which is exposed to highly fluctuating conditions in temperature, salinity, pH and oxygen levels during the seasonal as well as the tidal cycle. Thermal windows of tolerance and exercise performance were compared in three populations from the Russian White Sea, the German North Sea and the French Atlantic coast. Digging experiments in natural marine sediments quantified performance capacity and its optimum temperature. Temperature dependent ventilation and respiration were analysed in lugworms dwelling in artificial self-perfused burrows. Haemoglobin oxygen affinity was examined for an evaluation of population specific adaptations in the oxygen supply system. The results reflect a shift of both the thermal window and the thermal optimum towards higher temperatures with decreasing latitude. This shift was accompanied by a reduction of performance amplitude, i.e. the absolute number of digging periods, and a widening of the distance between critical temperatures, i.e. the total aerobic window of thermal tolerance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The paper describes the procedure for constructing a habitat suitability model from the distribution maps of a modelled species. If exact locations are not available, old and present thematic maps indicating species distribution can be used instead. We developed this procedure to create the brown bear (Ursus arctos) habitat suitability model in Slovakia. We took the source data from hunting statistics compiled annually for the whole country and linked bear numbers to the maps of hunting grounds. To be able to create a thematic layer of distribution, we merged the forested areas within hunting grounds occupied by bears and surrounded them with a spatial buffer. The absence layer was a complement to the presence one. For each layer, we randomly generated points for which the density of absence and presence points was the same. We prepared ten different datasets with an increasing number of points and characterised environmental conditions with 15 raster layers. We set up input parameters for five different GARP models and ran each of them on every data set of points and selected the variant with the best accuracy.The model matches well to present bear habitat in continuously forested areas. However, it also predicts a high probability of occurrence outside the current bear range. The absence of bears in predicted suitable habitats can be explained by liabilities in the model setup and insufficient description of environmental features such as forest fragmentation, human disturbance, and poaching. The results indicate that adjusting the model parameters is more significant than the density of input points. A priori probabilities of bear presence in land use categories can be integrated to modify the density of generated points. Average probabilities of the habitat suitability model for selected land categories matched reasonably well with the bear locations acquired by GPS telemetry. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Resource selection functions (RSFs) are typically estimated by comparing covariates at a discrete set of "used" locations to those from an "available" set of locations. This RSF approach treats the response as binary and does not account for intensity of use among habitat units where locations were recorded. Advances in global positioning system (GPS) technology allow animal location data to be collected at fine spatiotemporal scales and have increased the size and correlation of data used in RSF analyses. We suggest that a more contemporary approach to analyzing such data is to model intensity of use, which can be estimated for one or more animals by relating the relative frequency of locations in a set of sampling units to the habitat characteristics of those units with count-based regression and, in particular, negative binomial (NB) regression. We demonstrate this NB RSF approach with location data collected from 10 GPS-collared Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range enclosure. We discuss modeling assumptions and show how RSF estimation with NB regression can easily accommodate contemporary research needs, including: analysis of large GPS data sets, computational ease, accounting for among-animal variation, and interpretation of model covariates. We recommend the NB approach because of its conceptual and computational simplicity, and the fact that estimates of intensity of use are unbiased in the face of temporally correlated animal location data.},

	abstract = {Abundance estimation of carnivore populations is difficult and has prompted the use of non-invasive detection methods, such as remotely-triggered cameras, to collect data. To analyze photo data, studies focusing on carnivores with unique pelage patterns have utilized a mark-recapture framework and studies of carnivores without unique pelage patterns have used a mark-resight framework. We compared mark-resight and mark-recapture estimation methods to estimate bobcat (Lynx rufus) population sizes, which motivated the development of a new "hybrid" mark-resight model as an alternative to traditional methods. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the urban southern California study area. Additionally, we physically captured and marked a subset of the bobcat population with GPS telemetry collars. Since we could identify individual bobcats with photos of unique pelage patterns and a subset of the population was physically marked, we were able to use traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight methods, as well as the new "hybrid" mark-resight model we developed to estimate bobcat abundance. We recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights and physically marked 27 bobcats with GPS telemetry collars. Abundance estimates produced by the traditional mark-recapture, traditional mark-resight, and "hybrid" mark-resight methods were similar, however precision differed depending on the models used. Traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight estimates were relatively imprecise with percent confidence interval lengths exceeding 100\% of point estimates. Hybrid mark-resight models produced better precision with percent confidence intervals not exceeding 57\%. The increased precision of the hybrid mark-resight method stems from utilizing the complete encounter histories of physically marked individuals (including those never detected by a camera trap) and the encounter histories of naturally marked individuals detected at camera traps. This new estimator may be particularly useful for estimating abundance of uniquely identifiable species that are difficult to sample using camera traps alone.},

	abstract = {Aim Our aims are: (1) to highlight the power of dynamic occupancy models for analysing species range dynamics while accounting for imperfect detection; (2) to emphasize the flexibility to model effects of environmental covariates in the dynamics parameters (extinction and colonization probability); and (3) to illustrate the development of predictive maps of range dynamics by projecting estimated probabilities of occupancy, local extinction and colonization. Location Switzerland. Methods We used data from the Swiss breeding bird survey to model the Swiss range dynamics of the European crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) from 2000 to 2007. Within-season replicate surveys at each 1 km2 sample unit allowed us to fit dynamic occupancy models that account for imperfect detection, and thus estimate the following processes underlying the observed range dynamics: local extinction, colonization and detection. For comparison, we also fitted a model variant where detection was assumed to be perfect. Results All model parameters were affected by elevation, forest cover and elevation-by-forest cover interactions and exhibited substantial annual variation. Detection probability varied seasonally and among years, highlighting the need for its estimation. Projecting parameter estimates in environmental or geographical space is a powerful means of understanding what the model is telling about covariate relationships. Geographical maps were substantially different between the model where detection was estimated and that where it was not, emphasizing the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in studies of range dynamics, even for high-quality data. Main conclusions The study of species range dynamics is among the most exciting avenues for species distribution modelling. Dynamic occupancy models offer a robust framework for doing so, by accounting for imperfect detection and directly modelling the effects of covariates on the parameters that govern distributional change. Mapping parameter estimates modelled by spatially indexed covariates is an under-used way to gain insights into dynamic species distributions.},

	abstract = {Environmental niche models, which are generated by combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The question of whether environmental niches are conserved over evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic study of niche conservatism between sister species in several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time, address alternative definitions of "niche conservatism" within a single framework using consistent methods. As expected, we find that environmental niches of sister species are more similar than expected under three distinct null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in this group to consist of closely related species. We suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.},

Grasslands are highly affected in this process and are consequently among the most threatened semi-natural habitats in Europe. However, experimental evidence is scarce on the effects of management types on biodiversity. Moreover, management types need to be feasible within the recently changed socio-economic circumstances in Hungary. We investigated the effects of timing and frequency of mowing on the abundance of the scarce large blue butterfly (Phengaris teleius), on the abundance of its host plant and on the frequency of its host ant species. In each of four study meadows, we applied four types of management: one cut per year in May, one cut per year in September, two cuts per year (May and September) and cessation of management. After three years of experimental management, we found that adult butterflies preferred plots cut once in September over plots cut twice per year and abandoned ones, while plots cut once in May were also preferred over abandoned plots. Relative host plant abundance remarkably increased in plots cut once in September. Management did not affect the occupancy pattern of Myrmica host ants. Invasive goldenrod was successfully retained by two cuts per year. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to test management effects on the whole community module of a socially parasitic butterfly, its host plant and host ants.

	abstract = {The central-European population of wolves Canis lupus has its western border of contiguous range in eastern Poland. Protected since 1998, Polish wolves began to expand towards the west. Based on large-scale data on wolf abundance (2000-2006) and geographic information system (GIS) tools, we built a habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species in Poland. The best model, selected by the Akaike information criterion, of the resource selection function (RSF) by wolves included percentage cover of forests, meadows and marshes (positively correlated to wolf abundance) and road density (negatively correlated), and explained 53\% of the total variation in the wolf abundance index in a 10 +� 10 km cell grid. That RSF was then used to evaluate the whole country in terms of suitability for wolves. Potential wolf range appeared to consist of 24 patches of good habitat (predicted relative probability of wolf occurrence ≥ 30\%), including six patches already occupied and 17 new ones. In total, habitat suitable for wolves covers at least 20-24\% of Poland, compared with 16\% of the country's area now occupied by the species. HSM was validated with historical data on wolf occurrence in 1950-2006. The areas selected by our model and those inhabited by wolves in at least one decade overlapped in 81-86\%. Furthermore, the probability of wolf occurrence predicted by the model correlated positively with the number of decades the wolves were actually recorded in the area. Based on the empirical relationship between patch size and wolf numbers, we estimated that Poland could support a population of 1450-1540 wolves, two to three times larger than the current estimate. HSM needs to be supplemented with a GIS-based connectivity analysis among patches, which in turn should be validated by molecular genetics studies on dispersing wolves. Because of broadly similar geographic conditions, the model may be applicable to eastern Germany, Belarus Republic and the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia). -� Journal compilation -� 2008 The Zoological Society of London},

Real genetic data can be applied to simulations of genetic changes in populations of interest and subsequently used in risk assessment. Ancestral Mediterranean brown trout (Salmo trutta) lineages exhibit complex population structure among native populations. Genetically divergent Atlantic stocks were maintained and released in the Mediterranean rivers as recreational fish, which resulted in hybridization and introgression with local populations. Therefore, we designed a new supplementation program based on native stocks and evaluated the genetic risks associated with releasing native fish in recreational fisheries. Our simulation was delimited by the observed population genetic structure and available hatchery facilities in the study region. Supplementation with native stocks maintained estimates of gene diversity indexes (total diversity (H-T), local diversity (H-S), and population differentiation (G(ST))). However, simulations indicated that long-term supplementation significantly reduced genetic diversity among locations because of a homogenizing effect of populations along each management unit. Therefore, such reinforcements compromised the conservation of local genetic variation. Nevertheless, replacement of current foreign stocks with native stocks can be an important step towards promoting the value of preserving local diversity among anglers.},

	abstract = {The paper describes a new algorithm for solving the point-in-polygon problem. It is especially suitable when it is necessary to check whether many points are placed inside or outside a polygon. The algorithm works in two steps. First, a grid of cells equal in size is generated, and the polygon is laid on that grid. A heuristic approach is proposed for cell dimensioning. The cells of the grid are marked as being inside, outside, or on the polygon border. A modified flood-fill algorithm is applied for cell classification. In the second step, points are tested individually. If the tested point falls into an inner or an outer cell, the result is returned without any additional calculations. If the cell contains the polygon border, it is possible to determine the local point position. The analysis of time complexity shows that the initialization is finished in O(n ???n) time, while the expected time complexity for checking an individual point is O(???n), where n represents the number of polygon edges. The algorithm works with O(n) space complexity. The paper also gives practical results using artificial and real polygons from a GIS environment. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {1. Trends of animal populations are of great interest in ecology but cannot be directly observed owing to imperfect detection. Binomial mixture models use replicated counts to estimate abundance, corrected for detection, in demographically closed populations. Here, we extend these mod- els to open populations and illustrate them using sand lizard Lacerta agilis counts fromthe national Dutch reptilemonitoring scheme. 2. Our model requires replicated counts frommultiple sites in each of several periods, within which population closure is assumed. Counts are described by a hierarchical generalized linear model, where the state model deals with spatio-temporal patterns in true abundance and the observation model with imperfect counts, given that true state. We used WinBUGS to fit the model to lizard counts from208 transects with 1–10 (mean 3) replicate surveys during each spring 1994–2005. 3. Our state model for abundance contained two independent log-linear Poisson regressions on year for coastal and inland sites, and randomsite effects to account for unexplained heterogeneity. The observation model for detection of an individual lizard contained effects of region, survey date, temperature, observer experience and randomsurvey effects. 4. Lizard populations increased in both regions but more steeply on the coast. Detectability increased over the first fewyears of the study, was greater on the coast and for themost experienced observers, and highest around 1 June. Interestingly, the population increase inland was not detect- able when the observed counts were analysed without account of detectability. The proportional increase between 1994 and 2005 in total lizard abundance across all sites was estimated at 86\% (95\%CRI 35–151). 5. Synthesis and applications.Open-population binomial mixturemodels are attractive for studying true population dynamics while explicitly accounting for the observation process, i.e. imperfect detection. We emphasize the important conceptual benefit provided by temporal replicate observa- tions in terms of the interpretability of animal counts. Key-words:},

	abstract = {Assessment of abundance, survival, recruitment rates, and density (i.e., population assessment) is especially challenging for elusive species most in need of protection (e.g., rare carnivores). Individual identification methods, such as DNA sampling, provide ways of studying such species efficiently and noninvasively. Additionally, statistical methods that correct for undetected animals and account for locations where animals are captured are available to efficiently estimate density and other demographic parameters. We collected hair samples of European wildcat (Felis silvestris) from cheek-rub lure sticks, extracted DNA from the samples, and identified each animals’ genotype. To estimate the density of wildcats, we used Bayesian inference in a spatial capture-recapture model. We used WinBUGS to fit a model that accounted for differences in detection probability among individuals and seasons and between two lure arrays. We detected 21 individual wildcats (including possible hybrids) 47 times. Wildcat density was estimated at 0.29/km2 (SE 0.06), and 95\% of the activity of wildcats was estimated to occur within 1.83 km from their home-range center. Lures located systematically were associated with a greater number of detections than lures placed in a cell on the basis of expert opinion. Detection probability of individual cats was greatest in late March. Our model is a generalized linear mixed model; hence, it can be easily extended, for instance, to incorporate trap- and individual-level covariates. We believe that the combined use of noninvasive sampling techniques and spatial capture-recapture models will improve population assessments, especially for rare and elusive animals.},

	abstract = {1. Population assessment in changing environments is challenging because factors governing abundance may also affect detectability and thus bias observed counts. We describe a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating abundance corrected for detectability in metapopulation designs, where observations of 'individuals' (e.g. territories) are replicated in space and time. We consider two classes of models; first, we regard the data as independent binomial counts and model abundance and detectability based on a product-binomial likelihood. Secondly, we use the more complex detection-non-detection data for each territory to form encounter history frequencies, and analyse the resulting multinomial/Poisson hierarchical model. Importantly, we extend both models to directly estimate population trends over multiple years. Our models correct for any time trends in detectability when assessing population trends in abundance. 2. We illustrate both models for a farmland and a woodland bird species, skylark Alauda arvensis and willow tit Parus montanus, by applying them to Swiss BBS data, where 268 1 km(2) quadrats were surveyed two to three times during 1999-2003. We fit binomial and multinomial mixture models where log(abundance) depended on year, elevation, forest cover and transect route length, and logit(detection) on year, season and search effort. 3. Parameter estimates were very similar between models with confidence intervals overlapping for most parameters. Trend estimates were similar for skylark (-0.074 +/- 0.041 vs. -0.047 +/- 0.019) and willow tit (0.044 +/- 0.046 vs. 0.047 +/- 0.018). As expected, the multinomial model gave more precise estimates, but also yielded lower abundance estimates for the skylark. This may be due to effects of territory misclassification (lumping error), which do not affect the binomial model. 4. Both models appear useful for estimating abundance and population trends free from distortions by detectability in metapopulation designs with temporally replicated observations. The ability to obtain estimates of abundance and population trends that are unbiased with respect to any time trends in detectability ought to be a strong motivation for the collection of replicate observation data.},

	abstract = {Tropical dry-deciduous forests comprise more than45\%of the tiger (Panthera tigris) habitat in India.However, in the absence of rigorously derived estimates of ecological densities of tigers in dry forests, critical baseline data for managing tiger populations are lacking. In this study tiger densitieswere estimated using photographic capture–recapture sampling in the dry forests of Panna Tiger Reserve in Central India. Over a 45-day survey period, 60 camera trap sites were sampled in a well-protected part of the 542-km2 reserve during 2002. A total sampling effort of 914 camera-trap-days yielded photo-captures of 11 individual tigers over 15 samp- ling occasions that effectively covered a 418-km2 area. The closed capture–recapture model Mh,which incorporates individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities, fitted these photographic capture history data well. The estimated capture probability/sample, ˆ p=0.04, resulted in an estimated tiger population size and standard error ( ˆ N(S ˆ N)) of 29 (9.65), and a density ( ˆ E ˆ D(S ˆD)) of 6.94 (3.23) tigers/100km2. The estimated E ˆ tiger density matched predictions based on prey abundance. Our results suggest that, if managed appropriately, the available dry forest habitat in India has the potential to support a population size of about 9000 wild tigers. INTRODUCTION},

These quantities, however, are difficult to obtain for rare and elusive species, where even intensive sampling effort can yield sparse data. Here, we combine data from camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic sampling (scat surveys) of a jaguar population in the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil, where the species is threatened and little studied. We analyze data of both survey types separately and jointly in the framework of spatial capture-recapture. Density estimates were 1.45 (??0.46) for the camera-trap data alone, 2.03 (??0.77) for the genetic data alone, and 1.57 (??0.43) and 2.45 (??0.70) for the two methods, respectively, in the joint analysis. Density and other parameters were estimated more precisely in the joint model. Particularly the differences in movement between males and females were estimated much more precisely when combining both data sources, especially compared to the genetic data set alone. When compared to a previous non-spatial capture-recapture approach, present density estimates were more precise, demonstrating the superior statistical performance of spatial over non-spatial capture recapture models. The ability to combine different surveys into a single analysis with shared parameter allows for more precise population estimates, while at the same time enabling researchers to employ complementary survey techniques in the study of little known species. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The most widely used methods for incorporating these partial identity individuals into density analyses do not use all of the partial identity capture histories, reducing precision, and while not previously recognized, introducing bias. Here, we present the spatial partial identity model (SPIM), which uses the spatial location where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities, allowing all partial identity samples to be used in the analysis. We show that the SPIM out-performs other analytical alternatives. We then apply the SPIM to an ocelot data set collected on a trapping array with double-camera stations and a bobcat data set collected on a trapping array with single-camera stations. The SPIM improves inference in both cases and in the ocelot example, individual sex determined from photographs is used to further resolve partial identities, one of which is resolved to near certainty. The SPIM opens the door for the investigation of trapping designs that deviate from the standard 2 camera design, the combination of other data types between which identities cannot be deterministically linked, and can be extended to the problem of partial genotypes.},

To reveal spatial patterns, a statistical method should be spatially explicit, that is, it should directly take spatial information into account as a component of the adjusted model or of the optimized criterion. In this paper we propose a new spatially explicit multivariate method, spatial principal component analysis (sPCA), to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability using allelic frequency data of individuals or populations. This analysis does not require data to meet Hardy-Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium to exist between loci. The sPCA yields scores summarizing both the genetic variability and the spatial structure among individuals (or populations). Global structures (patches, clines and intermediates) are disentangled from local ones (strong genetic differences between neighbors) and from random noise. Two statistical tests are proposed to detect the existence of both types of patterns. As an illustration, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and sPCA are compared using simulated datasets and real georeferenced microsatellite data of Scandinavian brown bear individuals (Ursus arctos). sPCA performed better than PCA to reveal spatial genetic patterns.

	abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {* 1Estimating animal density using capture–recapture data from arrays of detection devices such as camera traps has been problematic due to the movement of individuals and heterogeneity in capture probability among them induced by differential exposure to trapping. * 2We develop a spatial capture–recapture model for estimating density from camera-trapping data which contains explicit models for the spatial point process governing the distribution of individuals and their exposure to and detection by traps. * 3We adopt a Bayesian approach to analysis of the hierarchical model using the technique of data augmentation. * 4The model is applied to photographic capture–recapture data on tigers Panthera tigris in Nagarahole reserve, India. Using this model, we estimate the density of tigers to be 14·3 animals per 100 km2 during 2004. * 5Synthesis and applications. Our modelling framework largely overcomes several weaknesses in conventional approaches to the estimation of animal density from trap arrays. It effectively deals with key problems such as individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities, movement of traps, presence of potential ‘holes’ in the array and ad hoc estimation of sample area. The formulation, thus, greatly enhances flexibility in the conduct of field surveys as well as in the analysis of data, from studies that may involve physical, photographic or DNA-based ‘captures’ of individual animals.},

	abstract = {We assessed the occurrence of a common river bird, the Plumbeous Redstart Rhyacornis fuliginosus, along 180 independent streams in the Indian and Nepali Himalaya. We then compared the performance of multiple discrimant analysis (MDA), logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) in predicting this species' presence or absence from 32 variables describing stream altitude, slope, habitat structure, chemistry and invertebrate abundance. Using the entire data (= training set) and a threshold for accepting presence in ANN and LR set to P ??? 0.5, ANN correctly classified marginally more cases (88\%) than either LR (83\%) or MDA (84\%). Model performance was assessed from two methods of data partitioning. In a 'leave-one-out' approach, LR correctly predicted more cases (82\%) than MDA (73\%) or ANN (69\%). However, in a holdout procedure, all the methods performed similarly (73-75\%). All methods predicted true absence (i.e. specificity in holdout: 81-85\%) better than true presence (i.e. sensitivity: 57-60\%). These effects reflect species' prevalence (= frequency of occurrence), but are seldom considered in distribution modelling. Despite occurring at only 36\% of the sites, Plumbeous Redstarts are one of the most common Himalayan river birds, and problems will be greater with less common species. Both LR and ANN require an arbitrary threshold probability (often P=0.5) at which to accept species presence from model prediction. Simulations involving varied prevalence revealed that LR was particularly sensitive to threshold effects. ROC plots (received operating characteristic) were therefore used to compare model performance on test data at a range of thresholds; LR always outperformed ANN. This case study supports the need to test species' distribution models with independent data, and to use a range of criteria in assessing model performance. ANN do not yet have major advantages over conventional multivariate methods for assessing bird distributions. LR and MDA were both more efficient in the use of computer time than ANN, and also more straightforward in providing testable hypotheses about environmental effects on occurrence. However, LR was apparently subject to chance significant effects from explanatory variables, emphasising the well-known risks of models based purely on correlative data.},

The model covers interpolation between zero and the observed number of samples, as well as extrapolation beyond the observed sample set. For interpolation (sample- based rarefaction), easily calculated, closed-form expressions for both expected richness and its confidence limits are developed (using the method of moments) that completely eliminate the need for resampling methods and permit direct statistical comparison of richness between sample sets. An incidence-based formof the Coleman (random-placement) model is developed and compared with the moment-based interpolation method. For ex- trapolation beyond the empirical sample set (and simultaneously, as an alternative method of interpolation), a likelihood-based estimator with a bootstrap confidence interval is de- scribed that relies on a sequential, AIC-guided algorithm to fit the mixture model parameters. Both the moment-based and likelihood-based estimators are illustrated with data sets for temperate birds and tropical seeds, ants, and trees. The moment-based estimator is confi- dently recommended for interpolation (sample-based rarefaction). For extrapolation, the likelihood-based estimator performs well for doubling or tripling the number of empirical samples, but it is not reliable for estimating the richness asymptote. The sensitivity of individual-based and sample-based rarefaction to spatial (or temporal) patchiness is dis- cussed.},

Population size was known in all instances, providing a basis for comparison of performance of estimators. Three replicates of three population sizes (30, 60, and 90 voles/enclosure) were used in this experiment. The most accurate and precise estimators, selected on the basis of four consecutive trapping occasions, were the Pollock and Otto's Mbh, Chao's Mh, and jackknife estimators. Examination of the hypothesis tests included in the Model Selection Procedure of the program CAPTURE identified in- dividual heterogeneity as the prevailing source of variation in capture probabilities and suggested that the appropriate estimator would be the jackknife. Reliability of the hetero- geneity estimators (the jackknife and Chao's estimators for Mh and Mth) was positively related to population size, whereas reliability of almost all of the other estimators varied inversely with population size. The jackknife estimator was unique in the stability and quality of its performance in the first few trap occasions. Using the jackknife estimator and three trap occasions offered the best tradeoff between reliability and trapping effort.},

	abstract = {1. Use-availability and presence-only analyses are synonyms. Both require two samples (one containing known locations, one containing potential locations), both estimate the same parameters, and both use the same fundamental likelihood. 2. Use-availability and presence-only designs compare characteristics of points where an organism was located to those where the organism could have been located. These designs can be generalized to estimate the relative probability that any event occurred at a set of locations. 3. This article generalizes the use-availability likelihood given in Johnson et al. (Resource selection functions based on use-availability data: theoretical motivation and evaluation methods, Journal of Wildlife Management, 2006) to point locations. This derivation arrives at the same likelihood as Fithian \& Hastie (Statistical Models for Presence-Only Data: Finite-Sample Equivalence and Addressing Observer Bias, 2012) but uses a different technique and allows a more general link function. Fithian \& Hastie (2012) use a case-control argument and Bayes theorem to derive the likelihood. This article uses Lagrangian multipliers to maximize the two-sample likelihood. 4. Resource selection functions (RSF) defined here are ratios of density functions. RSFs must be positive and unbounded. Proper link functions must provide proportionality over their entire range. Given these conditions, the exponential link is the most logical and appropriate link function for RSFs. These conditions exclude the logistic link. 5. This article affirms that estimation of a RSF does not involve 'running logistic regression'. By assigning 0 and 1 (pseudo-)responses to vectors of covariates associated with locations in the used and available sample, it is possible to 'trick' logistic regression software into maximizing the use-availability likelihood. Representing the analysis as 'logistic regression' is misleading because that implies use of the logistic link, which is inappropriate for RSF's. It is more accurate to state that the 'use-availability likelihood was maximized'. 6. RSFs are more general, intuitive and useful than resource selection probability functions (RSPF). RSPFs depend heavily on sampling mechanisms and the number of used and available locations selected. Consequently, the objective of estimation in use-availability studies should be the RSF, not the RSPF. 7. Two simple examples and R code in the Supporting Information illustrate computations. These examples maximize the general log likelihood without the aid of logistic regression software.},

	abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

	abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Specific behavioral and ecological characteristics make brown bear Ursus arctos a difficult species to study. We present a map of range and local population densities of brown bears in Slovenia, made with the use of a new approach similar to voting classifications based on a combination of four datasets: Global Positioning System telemetry data, records of bear removals, systematic and opportunistic direct observations and signs of bear presence, and noninvasive genetic samples. Results indicate that the majority of bears in Slovenia live in Dinaric Mountains in the southern part of the country where local bear population densities exceed 40 bears/100 km(2). This is one of the highest population densities reported so far for this species worldwide. Population densities decrease towards the north (Alpine region) and are very low along the border with Italy and Austria where almost no females are present. This explains slow past and present expansion of this transboundary bear population into the Alps and should be considered in future bear re-colonization management strategies. Results also showed that data from observations and removals overestimate bear population densities at low values, while mortality and genetic data overestimate population densities in areas with more people. Nevertheless, all data types appeared useful for describing the general bear distribution patterns. Similar approach could be applied to studies of other charismatic or game species, for which several types of data are often available.},

	abstract = {The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. Evaluating the predictive performance of models using independent data is a vital step in model development. Such evaluation assists in determining the suitability of a model for specific applications, facilitates comparative assessment of competing models and modelling techniques, and identifies aspects of a model most in need of improvement. The predictive performance of habitat models developed using logistic regression needs to be evaluated in terms of two components: Reliability or calibration (the agreement between predicted probabilities of occurrence and observed proportions of sites occupied), and discrimination capacity (the ability of a model to correctly distinguish between occupied and unoccupied sites). Lack of reliability can be attributed to two systematic sources, calibration bias and spread. Techniques are described for evaluating both of these sources of error. The discrimination capacity of logistic regression models is often measured by cross-classifying observations and predictions in a two-by-two table, and calculating indices of classification performance. However, this approach relies on the essentially arbitrary choice of a threshold probability to determine whether or not a site is predicted to be occupied. An alternative approach is described which measures discrimination capacity in terms of the area under a relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve relating relative proportions of correctly and incorrectly classified predictions over a wide and continuous range of threshold levels. Wider application of the techniques promoted in this paper could greatly improve understanding of the usefulness, and potential limitations, of habitat models developed for use in conservation planning and wildlife management.

This paper compares four such strategies, namely, 'random', 'regular', 'proportional-stratified' and 'equal-stratified'-to investigate (1) how they affect prediction accuracy and (2) how sensitive they are to sample size. In order to compare them, a virtual species approach (Ecol. Model. 145 (2001) 111) in a real landscape, based on reliable data, was chosen. The distribution of the virtual species was sampled 300 times using each of the four strategies in four sample sizes. The sampled data were then fed into a GLM to make two types of prediction: (1) habitat suitability and (2) presence/absence. Comparing the predictions to the known distribution of the virtual species allows model accuracy to be assessed. Habitat suitability predictions were assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient and presence/absence predictions by Cohen's ?? agreement coefficient. The results show the 'regular' and 'equal-stratified' sampling strategies to be the most accurate and most robust. We propose the following characteristics to improve sample design: (1) increase sample size, (2) prefer systematic to random sampling and (3) include environmental information in the design. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models are gaining popularity for estimating densities of mammalian carnivores. They use spatially explicit encounter histories of individual animals to estimate a detection probability function described by two parameters: magnitude (g0), and spatial scale (r). Carnivores exhibit heterogeneous detection probabilities and home range sizes, and exist at low densities, so g0 and r likely vary, but field surveys often yield inadequate data to detect and model the variation. We sampled American black bears (Ursus americanus) on 43 study areas in ON, Canada, 2006–2009. We detected 713 animals 1810 times; however, study area-specific samples were sometimes small (6–34 individuals detected 13–93 times). We compared AICc values from SECR models fit to the complete data set to evaluate support for various forms of variation in g0 and r, and to identify a parsimonious model for aggregating data among study areas to estimate detection parameters more precisely. Models that aggregated data within broad habitat classes and years were supported over those with study area-specific g0 and r (DAICc C 30), and precision was enhanced. Several other forms of variation in g0 and r, including individual heterogeneity, were also supported and affected density estimates. If study design cannot eliminate detection heterogeneity, it should ensure that samples are sufficient to detect and model it. Where this is not feasible, combing sparse data across multiple surveys could allow for improved inference.

	abstract = {With only 5\% of the world's wild tigers (Panthera tigris Linnaeus, 1758) remaining since the last century, conservationists urgently need to know whether or not the management strategies currently being employed are effectively protecting these tigers. This knowledge is contingent on the ability to reliably monitor tiger populations, or subsets, over space and time. In the this paper, we focus on the 2 seminal methodologies (camera trap and occupancy surveys) that have enabled the monitoring of tiger populations with greater confidence. Specifically, we: (i) describe their statistical theory and application in the field; (ii) discuss issues associated with their survey designs and state variable modeling; and, (iii) discuss their future directions. These methods have had an unprecedented influence on increasing statistical rigor within tiger surveys and, also, surveys of other carnivore species. Nevertheless, only 2 published camera trap studies have gone beyond single baseline assessments and actually monitored population trends. For low density tiger populations (e.g. {\textless}1 adult tiger/100 km(2)) obtaining sufficient precision for state variable estimates from camera trapping remains a challenge because of insufficient detection probabilities and/or sample sizes. Occupancy surveys have overcome this problem by redefining the sampling unit (e.g. grid cells and not individual tigers). Current research is focusing on developing spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture models and estimating abundance indices from landscape-scale occupancy surveys, as well as the use of genetic information for identifying and monitoring tigers. The widespread application of these monitoring methods in the field now enables complementary studies on the impact of the different threats to tiger populations and their response to varying management intervention.},

	abstract = {Herbivores are usually distributed unevenly across the landscape often because of variation in resource availability. We used zero-inflated generalised additive models (to account for data with a high number of zeros) that include georeferences to predict winter distribution of a large herbivore (moose Alces alces). Moose distribution was analysed in relation to forage availability and distance to neighbouring sites. Our results showed that the ability to explain moose distribution indexed by pellet count data at a local scale increased when spatial information (longitude and latitude) was added to the model compared to the model only including food availability. By using the relationship between moose and forage distribution, and the spatial information, we predicted patch choice by moose reasonably well in 2 out of 4 years. However, the distribution of moose was also influenced by weather conditions, as it was most clumped in the year with most snow. In conclusion, our study lends support for a non-linear approach using georeferences for a comprehensive understanding of herbivore distribution at a small scale. This result also indicates that the use of a certain patch by moose not only depends on the selected patch itself but is also influenced by the neighbouring patch and factors at a larger spatial scale, such as moose management influencing the density above moose home range level. The relatively high proportion of unexplained variation suggests that the use of a certain patch is also influenced by other factors such as topography, predation, competition, weather conditions, and wildlife management strategies.},

The choice of grain size (resolution) of environmental layers used in modelling is one important factor that may affect predictions. We applied 10 distinct modelling techniques to presence-only data for 50 species in five different regions, to test whether: (1) a 10-fold coarsening of resolution affects predictive performance of SDMs, and (2) any observed effects are dependent on the type of region, modelling technique, or species considered. Results show that a 10 times change in grain size does not severely affect predictions from species distribution models. The overall trend is towards degradation of model performance, but improvement can also be observed. Changing grain size does not equally affect models across regions, techniques, and species types. The strongest effect is on regions and species types, with tree species in the data sets (regions) with highest locational accuracy being most affected. Changing grain size had little influence on the ranking of techniques: boosted regression trees remain best at both resolutions. The number of occurrences used for model training had an important effect, with larger sample sizes resulting in better models, which tended to be more sensitive to grain. Effect of grain change was only noticeable for models reaching sufficient performance and/or with initial data that have an intrinsic error smaller than the coarser grain size.},

	abstract = {1.Understanding the factors affecting species occurrence is a pre-eminent focus of applied ecological research. However, direct information about species occurrence is lacking for many species. Instead, researchers sometimes have to rely on so-called presence-only data (i.e. when no direct information about absences is available), which often results from opportunistic, unstructured sampling. maxent is a widely used software program designed to model and map species distribution using presence-only data. 2.We provide a critical review of maxent as applied to species distribution modelling and discuss how it can lead to inferential errors. A chief concern is that maxent produces a number of poorly defined indices that are not directly related to the actual parameter of interest – the probability of occurrence (ψ). This focus on an index was motivated by the belief that it is not possible to estimate ψ from presence-only data; however, we demonstrate that ψ is identifiable using conventional likelihood methods under the assumptions of random sampling and constant probability of species detection. 3.The model is implemented in a convenient r package which we use to apply the model to simulated data and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We demonstrate that maxent produces extreme under-predictions when compared to estimates produced by logistic regression which uses the full (presence/absence) data set. We note that maxent predictions are extremely sensitive to specification of the background prevalence, which is not objectively estimated using the maxent method. 4.As with maxent, formal model-based inference requires a random sample of presence locations. Many presence-only data sets, such as those based on museum records and herbarium collections, may not satisfy this assumption. However, when sampling is random, we believe that inference should be based on formal methods that facilitate inference about interpretable ecological quantities instead of vaguely defined indices.},

Inclusion of a turning angle distribution enables explicit computation of the effect of persistence in the direction of travel on the expected magnitude of net displacement of the animal over time. We employed a form-analogous approach to obtain expressions for the expected net displacement and derived root mean square of the expected displacement of an animal at the end of a multi-step random walk in which turning angles were drawn from the Lemicon of Pascal, the elliptical, the von Mises, and the wrapped Cauchy distributions. The accuracy of these expressions for the expected magnitude of net displacement was tested by comparison with simulated results of persistent random walks where turning angles were drawn form the wrapped Cauchy distribution. Our results should be useful in predicting two-dimensional distribution of moving animals for which frequency distributions of the turning angles can be measured. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Yet, the increasing dependence on species-distribution models in identifying conservation priorities calls for a more critical evaluation of model robustness. We used 11 bird species of conservation concern in Brazil's highly fragmented Atlantic Forest and data on environmental conditions in the region to predict species distributions. These predictions were repeated for five different model types for each of the 11 bird species. We then combined these species distributions for each model separately and applied a reserve-selection algorithm to identify priority sites. We compared the potential outcomes from the reserve selection among the models. Although similarity in identification of conservation reserve networks occurred among models, models differed markedly in geographic scope and flexibility of reserve networks. It is essential for planners to evaluate the conservation implications of false-positive and false-negative errors for their specific management scenario before beginning the modeling process. Reserve networks selected by models that minimized false-positive errors provided a better match with priority areas identified by specialists. Thus, we urge caution in the use of models that overestimate species' occurrences because they may misdirect conservation action. Our approach further demonstrates the great potential value of museum records to biodiversity studies and the utility of species-distribution models to conservation decision-making. Our results also demonstrate, however, that these models must be applied critically and cautiously},

	abstract = {Networks of citizen scientists (CS) have the potential to observe biodiversity and species distributions at global scales. Yet the adoption of such datasets in conservation science may be hindered by a perception that the data are of low quality. This perception likely stems from the propensity of data generated by CS to contain greater levels of variability (e.g., measurement error) or bias (e.g., spatio-temporal clustering) in comparison to data collected by scientists or instruments. Modern analytical approaches can account for many types of error and bias typical of CS datasets. It is possible to (1) describe how pseudo-replication in sampling influences the overall variability in response data using mixed-effects modeling, (2) integrate data to explicitly model the sampling process and account for bias using a hierarchical modeling framework, and (3) examine the relative influence of many different or related explanatory factors using machine learning tools. Information from these modeling approaches can be used to predict species distributions and to estimate biodiversity. Even so, achieving the full potential from CS projects requires meta-data describing the sampling process, reference data to allow for standardization, and insightful modeling suitable to the question of interest. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that synonymous codons are used unevenly among genes in a genome. In organisms under translational selection, genes encoding highly expressed proteins are enriched with specific codons. This phenomenon, termed codon usage bias, is common to many organisms and has been recognized as influencing cellular fitness. This suggests that the global extent of codon usage bias of an organism might be associated with its phenotypic traits.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: To test this hypothesis we used a simple measure for assessing the extent of codon bias of an organism, and applied it to hundreds of sequenced prokaryotes. Our analysis revealed a large variability in this measure: there are organisms showing very high degrees of codon usage bias and organisms exhibiting almost no differential use of synonymous codons among different genes. Remarkably, we found that the extent of codon usage bias corresponds to the lifestyle of the organism. Especially, organisms able to live in a wide range of habitats exhibit high extents of codon usage bias, consistent with their need to adapt efficiently to different environments. Pathogenic prokaryotes also demonstrate higher extents of codon usage bias than non-pathogenic prokaryotes, in accord with the multiple environments that many pathogens occupy. Our results show that the previously observed correlation between growth rate and metabolic variability is attributed to their individual associations with codon usage bias.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the extent of codon usage bias of an organism plays a role in the adaptation of prokaryotes to their environments.},

	abstract = {Understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many studies of animal populations. Usually, such studies are based on location data obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSFs) are used for inference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and modeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models accomplish this objective using individual encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of capture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are intuitively related to RSFs, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. In this paper we develop the first statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource selection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera traps, mist-nets, or conventional catch traps, with resource selection data from telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the SCR and RSF models. Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR models alone can estimate parameters of RSFs and, as such, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage; however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. Finally, we find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter probability models may not fully explain variation in encounter probability due to space usage, and therefore produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage is related to resource selection. Consequently, it is important that space usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on estimating density using capture–recapture methods.},

The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt’s calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt’s outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

	abstract = {Advances in field techniques have lead to an increase in spatially-referenced capture-recapture data to estimate a species' population size as well as other demographic parameters and patterns of space usage. Statistical models for these data have assumed that the number of individuals in the population and their spatial locations follow a homogeneous Poisson point process model, which implies that the individuals are uniformly and independently distributed over the spatial domain of interest. In many applications there is reason to question independence, for example when species display territorial behavior. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model which allows for dependence between locations to account for avoidance or territorial behavior. We show via a simulation study that accounting for this can improve population size estimates. The method is illustrated using a case study of small mammal trapping data to estimate avoidance and population density of adult female field voles (Microtus agrestis) in northern England.},

	abstract = {The Far Eastern Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis; Schlegel, 1857) is perhaps the world's most endangered large felid subspecies occurring in a single population of ≤30 adults, and faces immediate risk of extinction unless additional populations can be established within its historical range in the Russian Far East. We used locations of leopard tracks (and their ungulate prey) collected from snow track surveys from 1997 to 2007 to develop resource selection functions (RSF) to identify potential habitat for reintroduction. We compared models that include prey versus those based on landscape covariates, and also included covariates related to human-induced mortality. To estimate potential population size, we used a habitat-based population estimate based on the ratio of population size and RSF value of occupied range. Far Eastern leopards selected for areas with high ungulate density, lower-elevation Korean pine forests on southwest facing slopes, and in areas far from human activity. Using this RSF model, we identified a total of 10,648km 2 in eight patches {\textgreater}500km 2 of potential Far Eastern leopard habitat that could harbor a potential population of 105.3 (57.9-147.2) adults. In combination with the existing population, successful reintroductions could result in a total of 139.2 (76.5-194.6) adult leopards, a 3-4-fold increase in population size. Our habitat models assist the reintroduction planning process by identifying factors that predict presence and potential suitable habitat. Identifying the highest quality, most connected patches, in combination with appropriate selection and training of released animals, is recommended for successfully reintroducing Far Eastern leopards, and potentially other endangered carnivores into the wild. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We documented a change in public support for wolf conservation and support for control of wolves. The change was a result of a real change in attitudes and not of a change in the age structure of the sampled population. The changes were documented in the two southern regions, Lika and Dalmatia, with attitudes shifting towards a more neutral viewpoint, as there was a decrease in support for wolf conservation and a decrease in support to control wolves. It seems that different birth cohorts react differently to conservation activities. In 1999, the younger cohort groups may have been influenced more by the legal protection campaign. The older cohorts reacted more sympathetically to livestock concerns and thus held stronger negative attitudes toward wolves. Using human dimensions research as an evaluative tool can help large carnivore managers be more adaptive and thus effective in their management solutions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We propose a new statistical framework for the exploratory analysis of the ecological niche, the "General niche-environment system factor analysis" (GNESFA). The data required for this analysis are (i) a table giving the values of the environmental variables in each environment unit (EU, e.g., the patches of habitat on a vector map), (ii) a set of weights measuring the availability of the EUs to the species (e.g., the proportion of the study area covered by a given patch), and (iii) a set of utilization weights describing the use of the EUs by the focal species (e.g., the proportion of detections of the species in each patch). Each row of the table corresponds to a point in the multidimensional space defined by the environmental variables, and each point is associated with two weights. The GNESFA searches the directions in this space where the two weight distributions differ the most, choosing one distribution as the reference, and the other one as the focus. The choice of the utilization as the reference corresponds to the MADIFA (Mahalanobis distances factor analysis), which identifies the directions on which the available EUs are in average the furthest from the optimum of the niche, allowing habitat suitability modelling. The choice of the availability as the reference corresponds to the FANTER (Factor analysis of the niche, taking the environment as the reference), which identifies the directions on which the niche is the furthest from the average environment (marginality) and those on which the niche is the narrowest compared with the environment (specialization). The commonly used ENFA (Ecological niche factor analysis) is at the middle point between the MADIFA and the FANTER, considering both distributions as the reference and the focus simultaneously. When used concurrently, these three analyses allow an extensive exploration of the system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Wolves Canis lupus recently recolonized the Western Alps through dispersal from the Italian Apennines, representing one of several worldwide examples of large carnivores increasing in highly human-dominated landscapes. Understanding and predicting expansion of this population is important for conservation because of its direct impact on livestock and its high level of societal opposition. 2. We built a predictive, spatially explicit, individual-based model to examine wolf population expansion in this fragmented landscape, and livestock depredation risk. We developed the model based on known demographic processes, social structure, behaviour and habitat selection of wolves collected during a 10-year intensive field study of this wolf population. 3. During model validation, our model accurately described the recolonization process within the Italian Alps, correctly predicting wolf pack locations, pack numbers and wolf population size, between 1999 and 2008. 4. We then projected packs and dispersers over the entire Italian Alps for 2013, 2018 and 2023. We predicted 25 packs (95\% CI: 19-32) in 2013, 36 (23-47) in 2018 and 49 (29-68) in 2023. The South-Western Alps were the main source for wolves repopulating the Alps from 1999 to 2008. The source area for further successful dispersers will probably shift to the North-Western Alps after 2008, but the large lakes in the Central Alps will probably act as a spatial barrier slowing the wolf expansion. 5. Using the pack presence forecasts, we estimated spatially explicit wolf depredation risk on livestock, allowing tailored local and regional management actions. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our predictive model is novel because we follow the spatio-temporal dynamics of packs, not just population size, which have substantially different requirements and impacts on wolf-human conflicts than wandering dispersers. Our approach enables prioritization of management efforts, including minimizing livestock depredations, identifying important corridors and barriers, and locating future source populations for successful wolf recolonization of the Alps.},

The present work gives an overview of the structure of the RSAGA package, and demonstrates its usefulness in the context of landslide susceptibility modeling with terrain attributes and generalized additive models (GAMs). The GAM is an extension of the generalized linear model (e.g. linear and logistic regression). It is able to model nonlinear relationships, but retains an interpretable additive structure. In the case study on landslide distribution in the Ecuadorian Andes, several local as well as catchment‐related morphometric attributes are important, mostly nonlinear predictors of landslide occurrence. Other applications that can benefit from an integration of modern statistical computing techniques and GIS‐based digital terrain analysis include pedometrics, Precision Agriculture, and species habitat studies.},

	abstract = {Within a landscape where prey has an aggregated distribution, predators can take advantage of the spatial autocorrelation of prey density and intensify their search effort in areas of high prey density by using area-restricted search behaviour. In African arid and semi-arid savannas, large herbivores tend to aggregate around scarce water sources. We tested the hypothesis that water sources are a key determinant of habitat selection and movement patterns of large free-ranging predators in such savannas, using the example of the African lion. We used data from 19 GPS radio-collared lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Maps of lions' trajectories showed that waterholes are key loci on the lions' route-maps. Compositional analyses revealed that lions significantly selected for areas located within 2 km of a waterhole. In addition, analysis of lions' night paths showed that when lions are close to a waterhole ({\textless} 2 km), they move at lower speed, cover shorter distances per night (both path length and net displacement) and follow a more tortuous path (higher turning angle, lower straightness index and higher fractal dimension) than when they are further from a waterhole. Hence, our results strongly suggest that lions adopt area-restricted searching in the vicinity of waterholes, and reduce their search effort to minimize the time spent far from a waterhole. They provide an illustration of how key habitat features that determine the dispersion of prey (e.g. waterholes in this study) have an influence on the spatial ecology and movement patterns of terrestrial predators.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data.

This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

The data generated from this sampling differ from traditional mark-recapture data in that individuals may be captured multiple times within a session or there may only be a single sampling event. To accommodate this type of data, we develop a method, named capwire, based on a simple urn model containing individuals of two capture probabilities. The method is evaluated using simulations of an urn and of a more biologically realistic system where individuals occupy space, and display heterogeneous movement and DNA deposition patterns. We also analyse a small number of real data sets. The results indicate that when the data contain capture heterogeneity the method provides estimates with small bias and good coverage, along with high accuracy and precision. Performance is not as consistent when capture rates are homogeneous and when dealing with populations substantially larger than 100. For the few real data sets where N is approximately known, capwire's estimates are very good. We compare capwire's performance to commonly used rarefaction methods and to two heterogeneity estimators in program CAPTURE: M-h(h)-Chao and M-jackknife. No method works best in all situations. While less precise, the Chao estimator is very robust. We also examine how large samples should be to achieve a given level of accuracy using capwire. We conclude that capwire provides an improved way to estimate N for some DNA-based data sets.},

	abstract = {1. Open population mark–recapture analysis of unbounded populations accommodates some types of closure violations (e.g. emigration, immigration). In contrast, closed population analysis of such populations readily allows estimation of capture heterogeneity and behavioural response, but requires crucial assumptions about closure (e.g. no permanent emigration) that are suspect and rarely tested empirically. 2. In 2003, we erected a double-sided barrier to prevent movement of snakes in or out of a 5-ha semi-forested study site in northern Guam. This geographically closed population of {\textgreater}100 snakes was monitored using a series of transects for visual searches and a 13 × 13 trapping array, with the aim of marking all snakes within the site. Forty-five marked snakes were also supplemented into the resident population to quantify the efficacy of our sampling methods. We used the program mark to analyse trap captures (101 occasions), referenced to census data from visual surveys, and quantified heterogeneity, behavioural response, and size bias in trappability. Analytical inclusion of untrapped individuals greatly improved precision in the estimation of some covariate effects. 3. A novel discovery was that trap captures for individual snakes consisted of asynchronous bouts of high capture probability lasting about 7 days (ephemeral behavioural effect). There was modest behavioural response (trap happiness) and significant latent (unexplained) heterogeneity, with small influences on capture success of date, gender, residency status (translocated or not), and body condition. 4. Trapping was shown to be an effective tool for eradicating large brown treesnakes Boiga irre- gularis ({\textgreater}900 mm snout-vent length, SVL). 5. Synthesis and applications. Mark–recapture modelling is commonly used by ecological managers to estimate populations. However, existing models involve making assumptions about either closure violations or response to capture. Physical closure of our population on a landscape scale allowed us to determine the relative importance of covariates influencing capture probability (body size, trappability periods, and latent heterogeneity). This information was used to develop models in which different segments of the population could be assigned different probabilities of capture, and suggests that modelling of open populations should incorporate easily measured, but poten- tially overlooked, parameters such as body size or condition.},

	abstract = {Owing to the Eurasian badger's Meles meles role as an agricultural pest, its potential role in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis and other management problems, accurate estimation of badger abundance is required. At present, no censusing method exists that is accurate, cost-effective and relatively non-invasive. In this article, we test the feasibility of estimating badger social group and population size by genotyping DNA extracted from remotely plucked hair, obtained using unbaited barbed-wire traps suspended above runs and main sett entrances. Social group size was independently estimated by direct observation. The study was performed on 11 social groups in a population in Luxembourg, and hair samples were collected on alternate days during a four-week period. A total of 332 hair samples was collected, from which 303 single-hair extracts gave rise to a complete genetic profile after a single round of amplification. Of 48 multiple-hair extracts, 23\% gave rise to a mixed profile from multiple contributors. Of samples collected from different barbs of the same trap on the same collection day, 53\% originated from different individuals. After applying two error-checking protocols, an extended singles filter and a mismatch filter, 55 unique profiles were obtained. Mark-recapture analysis estimated the population to contain 61 badgers, whereas direct observation suggested a population of 49 badgers. By comparison with direct observation, hair-trapping yielded a higher estimate for six social groups, an equal estimate for four groups and a lower estimate for one group. We conclude that hair-trapping by means of unbaited barbed-wire traps, placed at sett entrances and well-used runs, offers a method of censusing badgers that is relatively accurate and precise, comparatively non-invasive, potentially applicable in a variety of habitats and at different population densities, and not prohibitively expensive. We suggest that DNA should be extracted from single hairs, rather than from hairs pooled from a single barb or a single trap, in order to avoid mixed profiles. ¬¨¬© Wildlife Biology (2007).},

Central to the theory is a single quantity oc, which we call the hetero- geneity index and which measures the variability in the detectability of individuals. This theory also has implications for the analysis of independent observer line transect surveys. An estimator of ox is provided by combining kernel density estimates of the underlying densities of the covariate, conditional on capture histories. We derive expressions for the asymptotic bias and variance and show that our new estimator is as efficient as the Petersen estimator when individuals all have the sames detectability.

	abstract = {The effective population size (N(e) ) could be the ideal parameter for monitoring populations of conservation concern as it conveniently summarizes both the evolutionary potential of the population and its sensitivity to genetic stochasticity. However, tracing its change through time is difficult in natural populations. We applied four new methods for estimating N(e) from a single sample of genotypes to trace temporal change in N(e) for bears in the Northern Dinaric Mountains. We genotyped 510 bears using 20 microsatellite loci and determined their age. The samples were organized into cohorts with regard to the year when the animals were born and yearly samples with age categories for every year when they were alive. We used the Estimator by Parentage Assignment (EPA) to directly estimate both N(e) and generation interval for each yearly sample. For cohorts, we estimated the effective number of breeders (N(b) ) using linkage disequilibrium, sibship assignment and approximate Bayesian computation methods and extrapolated these estimates to N(e) using the generation interval. The N(e) estimate by EPA is 276 (183-350 95\% CI), meeting the inbreeding-avoidance criterion of N(e) {\textgreater} 50 but short of the long-term minimum viable population goal of N(e) {\textgreater} 500. The results obtained by the other methods are highly consistent with this result, and all indicate a rapid increase in N(e) probably in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The new single-sample approaches to the estimation of N(e) provide efficient means for including N(e) in monitoring frameworks and will be of great importance for future management and conservation.},

	abstract = {: The status of the swift fox ( Vulpes velox) became a subject of controversy when a petition was submitted in 1992 to have it listed under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. Colorado is believed to have 1 of the largest remaining populations of the species due to significant amounts of short-grass prairie habitat suitable for occupancy. In 1995, we initiated a survey in eastern Colorado to determine swift fox population size and presence or absence on 72 4.8 x 6.4 km2 grids trapped with 20 live traps. We drew trapping grids from a stratified random sample of grids plot- ted on 1:100,000 scale Gap vegetation maps of eastern Colorado. Of the grids sampled, 54\% were from areas with 75\% short-grass habitat. We captured 241 swift foxes (117 male, 121 female, and 3 undetermined) on 51 (71\%) of the grids. We estimated a mean capture probability per night of an individual fox, weighted by number of grids and number of trapping occasions for each grid, as 0.234 (SE = 0.022). Highest capture and detection probabilities occurred during the September to March period. We estimated the average number of foxes per grid as 6.96 (SE = 0.794), likely a max- imum estimate because of foxes being attracted to the trapping grids. Percentage of short-grass prairie habitat on each grid was an important predictor of both occupancy rate and detection probabilities. We estimated occupancy rate of the 72 grids trapped as 0.821 (SE = 0.0659), using the mean (66.9\%) of the short-grass prairie habitat for the 72 grids as a covariate, suggesting that 59.1 (SE = 4.74) of the 72 grids trapped contained foxes. Alternatively, using the percentage of short grass prairie for each grid to estimate a grid-specific occupancy probability, we estimated 56.9 (SE = 4.13) of the 72 grids contained foxes. We estimated nightly detection probabilities of {\textgreater}0.60 for grids trapped in March. We used simulation to compute the power to detect simulated changes in occupancy rates assuming a detection probability of 0.6 and an occupancy rate of 0.8. With only 2 trapping occasions, even with 100 trapping grids, the power was only 80\% to detect a change in occupancy from 0.8 to 0.5. With 50 trapping grids and 3 trapping occa- sions, the power was nearly 80\% to detect a 0.3 reduction in occupancy rate and {\textgreater}80\% for 4 trapping occasions.},

	abstract = {The tarpon Genetic Recapture Study started in an effort to determine how often a tarpon is caught and released in Florida’s growing and lucrative fishery by using DNA fingerprinting techniques as a tool to identify and track individual tarpon. Previous research on central and southwest Gulf of Mexico fisheries showed that most tarpon can survive short-term catch-and-release fishing practices. However, fishing pressure is intense during peak season, and tarpon fishing varies in time and space throughout the state. In this study, a novel method of obtaining fish tissue replaced traditional fin clipping, and citizen-scientists were utilized to collect DNA samples and record capture information from tarpon they caught. Benefits of using citizen scientists included being able to sample fish statewide and collect data on a species that is difficult to catch in great number. From the pilot study in 2005 through the study’s end in 2014, 24,572 samples were received from volunteer anglers throughout the coastal southeastern United States, and of those, 22,992 were collected from tarpon caught in Florida waters. tarpon samples were returned from fish caught along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and Florida Keys, but regionally the database was depauperate in samples from north Florida. Public outreach was a critical and integral component of study promotion and angler involvement. Future work based on recapture data will provide information needed to estimate recapture rates, evaluate seasonal and regional movement patterns, determine site fidelity, establish connectivity of tarpon in Florida waters and over the long-term could determine if juvenile tarpon sampled within Florida nursery habitats supply the adult fishery.},

A related approach for estimating the current size of a breeding population, explored here for the first time, is the use of genetic 'marks' reconstructed for otherwise unknown parents in paternity or maternity analyses of progeny arrays. This method provides interesting similarities and contrasts to traditional mark-recapture methods based on physical tags. To illustrate, this genetic method is applied to a population of painted turtles on the Mississippi River to estimate the number of successfully breeding males. Non-genetic mark-recapture approaches were also applied to animals trapped at this location. Results demonstrate that such genetic data on parentage can be helpful not only in estimating contemporary population sizes, but also in providing additional information, not present in customary mark-recapture data, about possible extended movements of breeding individuals and the size of the pool of mates which they encounter.},

	abstract = {Wildlife monitoring technology is advancing rapidly and the use of remote sensors such as camera traps and acoustic detectors is becoming common in both the terrestrial and marine environments. Current methods to estimate abundance or density require individual recognition of animals or knowing the distance of the animal from the sensor, which is often difficult. A method without these requirements, the random encounter model (REM), has been successfully applied to estimate animal densities from count data generated from camera traps. However, count data from acoustic detectors do not fit the assumptions of the REM due to the directionality of animal signals. We developed a generalised REM (gREM), to estimate absolute animal density from count data from both camera traps and acoustic detectors. We derived the gREM for different combinations of sensor detection widths and animal signal widths (a measure of directionality). We tested the accuracy and precision of this model using simulations of different combinations of sensor detection widths and animal signal widths, number of captures and models of animal movement. We find that the gREM produces accurate estimates of absolute animal density for all combinations of sensor detection widths and animal signal widths. However, larger sensor detection and animal signal widths were found to be more precise. While the model is accurate for all capture efforts tested, the precision of the estimate increases with the number of captures. We found no effect of different animal movement models on the accuracy and precision of the gREM. We conclude that the gREM provides an effective method to estimate absolute animal densities from remote sensor count data over a range of sensor and animal signal widths. The gREM is applicable for count data obtained in both marine and terrestrial environments, visually or acoustically (e.g. big cats, sharks, birds, echolocating bats and cetaceans). As sensors such as camera traps and acoustic detectors become more ubiquitous, the gREM will be increasingly useful for monitoring unmarked animal populations across broad spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales.},

Under this approach, the data are augmented with all-zero detection histories. The resulting augmented dataset is modeled as a zero-inflated version of the complete-data model where an estimable zero-inflation parameter takes the place of the unknownmultinomial index. Interestingly, data augmentation can be justified as being equivalent to imposing a discrete uniform prior on the multinomial index.We provide three examples involving estimating the size of an animal population, estimating the number of diabetes cases in a population using the Rasch model, and the motivating example of estimating the number of species in an animal community with latent probabilities of species occurrence and detection.},

	abstract = {1. Meta-analysis is a powerful and informative tool for basic and applied research. It provides a statistical framework for synthesizing and comparing the results of studies which have all tested a particular hypothesis. Meta-analysis has the potential to be particularly useful for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, as individual experiments often rely on small sample sizes due to the constraints of time and manpower, and therefore have low statistical power. 2. The rewards of conducting a meta-analysis can be significant. It can be the basis of a systematic review of a topic that provides a powerful exploration of key hypotheses or theoretical assumptions, thereby influencing the future development of a field of research. Alternatively, for the applied scientist, it can provide robust answers to questions of ecological, medical or economic significance. However, planning and conducting a meta-analysis can be a daunting prospect and the analysis itself is invariably demanding and labour intensive. Errors or omissions made at the planning stage can create weeks of extra work. 3. While a range of useful resources is available to help the budding meta-analyst on his or her way, much of the key information and explanation is spread across different articles and textbooks. In order to help the reader use the available information as efficiently as possible (and so avoid making time-consuming errors) this article aims to provide a ‘road map’ to the existing literature. It provides a brief guide to planning, organizing and implementing a meta-analysis which focuses more on logic and implementation than on maths; it is intended to be a first port of call for those interested in the topic and should be used in conjunction with the more detailed books and articles referenced. In the main, references are cited and discussed with an emphasis on useful reading order rather than a chronological history of meta-analysis and its uses. 4. No prior knowledge of meta-analysis is assumed in the current article, though it is assumed that the reader is familiar with anova and regression-type statistical models.},

	abstract = {Due to global environmental changes, species are appearing more frequently in places where they have not previously occurred, and this trend is expected to continue. Such range expansions can create considerable challenges and confusion for management and policy, especially for species associated with conflicts and whose management is influenced by international legal frameworks. The golden jackal (Canis aureus) in Europe represents a good case study to address the questions related to management of naturally expanding species. We review the recent expansion of the golden jackal across the con- tinent, and address several ensuing policy and legal questions that also have clear impli- cations for other expanding species. To that end, we analyze the EU Habitats Directive and several other international legal instruments including the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Bern Convention on European Wildlife. We also review the status of the golden jackal under national legislation and highlight some of the management confusion due to recent range expansion and inadequate legal interpretation. Specific questions we address include in which cases an expanding species is to be considered an (invasive) alien species in countries where it did not formerly occur; what countries’ conservation obli- gations are with respect to expanding species; what difference it makes for those obliga- tions whether or not a species historically occurred in a country; what scope exists for lethal control of its populations; what the prospects are for transboundary cooperation at the population level; and what responses are required when colonizing species hybridise with other wildlife or domestic animals.},

	abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) radio-collars are increasingly used to estimate Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) kill rates. In interpreting results from this technology, researchers make various assumptions about wolf behavior around kills, yet no detailed description of this behavior has been published. This article describes the behavior of six wolves in an area of constant daylight during 30 hours, from when the pack killed a Muskox (Ovibos moschatus) calf and yearling on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, to when they abandoned the kill remains. Although this is only a single incident, it demonstrates one possible scenario of pack behavior around a kill. Combined with the literature, this observation supports placing a radio-collar on the breeding male to maximize finding kills via GPS collars and qualifying results depending on whatever other information is available about the collared wolf's pack.},

	abstract = {Advances in molecular biology offer promise to the study of demographic characteristics of rare or hard-re-capture species, because individuals can now be identified through noninvasive sampling such as fecal collection or hair snags. However, individual genotyping using such methods currently leads to a novel problem that we call a "shadow effect," because some animals not captured previously are believed to be recaptures due to their DNA profile being an indistinguishable shadow of previously captured animals. We evaluate the impact of the shadow effect on the two methods most commonly used in applied population ecology to estimate the size of closed populations: Lincoln-Petersen and multiple-recapture estimators in program CAPTURE. We find that the shadow effect can cause a negative bias in the estimates of both the number of different animals and the number of different genotypes. Furthermore, with Lincoln-Petersen estimators, the shadow effect can cause estimated confidence intervals to decrease even as bias increases. Because the bias arises from heterogeneity in apparent "capture" probabilities for animals with genetic shadows vs. those without, a model in program CAPTURE that is robust to capture heterogeneity (Mh-jackknife) does not underestimate the number of genotypes in the population and only slightly underestimates the rotal number of individuals As the shadow effect increases, CAPTURE is better able to correctly identify heterogeneity in capture probability and to pick Mh-jackknife, so that the higher levels of shadow effect have less bias than medium levels. The shadow effect will occur in all estimates of demographic rates (including survival) that use DNA sampling to determine individual identity, but it can be minimized by increasing the number of individual loci sampled.},

	abstract = {Recent reports show that fewer adolescents believe that regular cannabis use is harmful to health. Concomitantly, adolescents are initiating cannabis use at younger ages, and more adolescents are using cannabis on a daily basis. The purpose of the present study was to test the association between persistent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline and determine whether decline is concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a prospective study of a birth cohort of 1,037 individuals followed from birth (1972/1973) to age 38 y. Cannabis use was ascertained in interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 y. Neuropsychological testing was conducted at age 13 y, before initiation of cannabis use, and again at age 38 y, after a pattern of persistent cannabis use had developed. Persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education. Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline. Further, cessation of cannabis use did not fully restore neuropsychological functioning among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain and highlight the importance of prevention and policy efforts targeting adolescents.},

Four steps are involved in the estimation. First, presumed coyote faeces are collected along paths or roadways where coyotes, like most carnivores, often defaecate and mark territorial boundaries. Second, DNA is extracted from the faeces and species identity and sex is determined by mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome typing. Third, hypervariable microsatellite loci are typed from the faeces. Lastly, rarefaction analysis is used to estimate population size from faecal genotypes. This method readily provides a point count estimate of population size and sex ratio. Additionally, we show that home range use paternity and kinship can be inferred from the distribution and relatedness patterns of faecal genotypes.},

	abstract = {Ecologists carry a well-stocked toolbox with a great variety of sampling methods, statistical analyses and modelling tools, and new methods are constantly appearing. Evaluation and optimisation of these methods is crucial to guide methodological choices. Simulating error-free data or taking high-quality data to qualify methods is common practice. Here, we emphasise the methodology of the 'virtual ecologist' (VE) approach where simulated data and observer models are used to mimic real species and how they are 'virtually' observed. This virtual data is then subjected to statistical analyses and modelling, and the results are evaluated against the 'true' simulated data. The VE approach is an intuitive and powerful evaluation framework that allows a quality assessment of sampling protocols, analyses and modelling tools. It works under controlled conditions as well as under consideration of confounding factors such as animal movement and biased observer behaviour. In this review, we promote the approach as a rigorous research tool, and demonstrate its capabilities and practical relevance. We explore past uses of VE in different ecological research fields, where it mainly has been used to test and improve sampling regimes as well as for testing and comparing models, for example species distribution models. We discuss its benefits as well as potential limitations, and provide some practical considerations for designing VE studies. Finally, research fields are identified for which the approach could be useful in the future. We conclude that VE could foster the integration of theoretical and empirical work and stimulate work that goes far beyond sampling methods, leading to new questions, theories, and better mechanistic understanding of ecological systems.},

	abstract = {The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the largest feline in the Americas and third largest world-wide, smaller in size only to the tiger (P. tigris) and lion (P. leo). Yet, in comparison, relatively few studies on jaguar population densities have been conducted and baseline data for management purposes are needed. Camera trapping and capture-recapture sampling methods were used to estimate the size of a jaguar population in the Pantanal's open wet grassland habitat, an important area for the long-term survival of the species. This study is the first jaguar population estimate conducted in co-operation with a GPS-telemetry study providing an important opportunity for comparing different methods of density estimation. An accessible area within a 460 km2 privately-owned ranch was sampled with equal effort during the dry seasons of 2003 and 2004. Thirty-one and twenty-five individual jaguars were identified in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Estimates of jaguar abundance were generated by program CAPTURE. Density estimates were produced according to different methods used to calculate the effectively sampled areas which ranged from 274 to 568 km2. For 2003, the currently-used mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) method produced a density of 10.3 jaguars/100 km2, while GPS-telemetry-based calculations produced a mean density of 6.6 jaguars/100 km2. For 2004, the MMDM method produced an estimate of 11.7 jaguars/100 km2 while GPS-telemetry calculations produced a density of 6.7 jaguars/100 km2. Our results suggest that the widely-used MMDM method used to calculate effectively sampled areas is significantly under-reflecting maximum distances moved by jaguars and their range-use and, thereby, considerably inflating cat density estimates. This overestimation could place a population in a difficult situation by lengthening the time taken to initiate protection measures because of underestimating the risk to that population. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The concept of wolf habitat and relative suitability has changed significantly over the past several decades. In large part, this occurred because of insights gained during expansion of the wolf population in the northern Great Lakes states (Mech 1970 ; Erb and DonCarlos, this volume; Beyer et al., this volume; Wydeven et al., this volume). Protection from intentional killing of wolves since 1974, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, began the process of wolf population growth and expansion in northeastern Minnesota, with eventual recolonization of northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan (Beyer et al., this volume; Wydeven et al., this volume). In 1955, Wisconsin game manager John Keener wrote about wolves, This animal is a symbol of the true wilderness. He cannot tolerate the advancing civilization of his wild home (Keener 1955 : 22). As late as the 1980s it was still generally believed that wolves required wilderness to survive, though research was beginning to show otherwise (Mech et al. 1988 ; Mech 1989) . This concept lasted for so long in part because wolves had persisted only in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and adjacent areas of the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota (Erb and DonCarlos, this volume), as well as Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior (Vucetich and Peterson, this volume). Gradually, it became clearer that the role of wilderness was largely one of protection for wolves from killing through reduced human accessibility, rather than any innate requirements of wolves and their behavior (Mech 1995) . With protection, wolves colonized areas with greater human presence. At the same time, remoteness clearly has a positive effect on wolf survival because of reduced conflict with humans, reduced accidental killing of wolves (such as by vehicles), and perhaps less disease, as well as less intentional illegal killing. Remoteness provides one relative factor in defining degrees of habitat suitability for wolves. The other important factor is prey abundance. Ironically, in today s human-dominated landscape, these factors are often in conflict. Human-dominated landscapes, both forests subject to harvesting and re-growth and agricultural lands, support high levels of prey (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus ) abundance. But by supporting higher abundance of prey, these human-dominated landscapes can also support a higher wolf population. Greater wolf human conflict ultimately often results (Mladenoff et al. 1997) . Areas with more intensive forest management and agriculture provide highly productive deer habitat. In the Great Lakes states, this gradient of productivity is controlled primarily by climate and soils, and declines generally from north to south. This gradient today largely follows the increasing area and productivity of agriculture from north to south (Fig. 8.1 ). Agriculture maintains productive browse and grazing within reach of deer, and the intensive nutrient inputs to crops and pasture accentuate the attractiveness of crops to deer, as well as providing livestock (prey) availability to wolves (Treves et al. 2002) .},

Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

	abstract = {Reliable estimates of population size are fundamental in many ecological studies and biodiversity conservation. Selecting appropriate methods to estimate abundance is often very difficult, especially if data are scarce. Most studies concerning the reliability of different estimators used simulation data based on assumptions about capture variability that do not necessarily reflect conditions in natural populations. Here, we used data from an intensively studied closed population of the arboreal gecko Gehyra variegata to construct reference population sizes for assessing twelve different population size estimators in terms of bias, precision, accuracy, and their 95\%-confidence intervals. Two of the reference populations reflect natural biological entities, whereas the other reference populations reflect artificial subsets of the population. Since individual heterogeneity was assumed, we tested modifications of the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, a set of models in programs MARK and CARE-2, and a truncated geometric distribution. Ranking of methods was similar across criteria. Models accounting for individual heterogeneity performed best in all assessment criteria. For populations from heterogeneous habitats without obvious covariates explaining individual heterogeneity, we recommend using the moment estimator or the interpolated jackknife estimator (both implemented in CAPTURE/MARK). If data for capture frequencies are substantial, we recommend the sample coverage or the estimating equation (both models implemented in CARE-2). Depending on the distribution of catchabilities, our proposed multiple Lincoln-Petersen and a truncated geometric distribution obtained comparably good results. The former usually resulted in a minimum population size and the latter can be recommended when there is a long tail of low capture probabilities. Models with covariates and mixture models performed poorly. Our approach identified suitable methods and extended options to evaluate the performance of mark-recapture population size estimators under field conditions, which is essential for selecting an appropriate method and obtaining reliable results in ecology and conservation biology, and thus for sound management.},

Given that a large number of field biologists prefer softwarewith graphical user interfaces for analysing their data, SPACECAP is particularly useful as a tool to increase the adoption of Bayesian spatially explicit capture– recapturemethods in practice.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive genetic methods can be used to estimate animal abundances and offer several advantages over conventional methods. Few attempts have been made, however, to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the estimates. We compared four methods of estimating population size based on fecal sampling. Two methods used rarefaction indices and two were based on capture-mark-recapture (CMR) estimators, one combining genetic and field data. Volunteer hunters and others collected 1904 fecal samples over 2 consecutive years in a large area containing a well-studied population of brown bears (Ursus arctos). On our 49,000-km(2) study area in south-central Sweden, population size estimates ranged from 378 to 572 bears in 2001 and 273 to 433 bears in 2002, depending on the method of estimation used. The estimates from the best model in the program MARK appeared to be the most accurate, based on the minimum population size estimate from radio-marked bears in a subsection of our sampling area. In addition, MARK models included heterogeneity and temporal variation in detection probabilities, which appeared to be present in our samples. All methods, though, incorrectly suggested a biased sex ratio, probably because of sex differences in detection probabilities and low overall detection probabilities. The population size of elusive animals can be estimated reliably over large areas with noninvasive genetic methods, but we stress the importance of an adequate and well-distributed sampling effort. In cases of biased sampling, calibration with independent estimates may be necessary. We recommend that this noninvasive genetic approach, using the MARK models, be used in the future in areas where sufficient numbers of volunteers can be mobilized.},

We suppose that trap- and individual-specific capture probabilities are a function of distance between individual home range centers and trap locations. We show that the models can be regarded as generalized linear mixed models, where the individual home range centers are random effects. We adopt a Bayesian framework for inference under these models using a formulation based on data augmentation. We apply the models to camera trapping data on tigers from the Nagarahole Reserve, India, collected over 48 nights in 2006. For this study, 120 camera locations were used, but cameras were only operational at 30 locations during any given sample occasion.

	abstract = {Statistical models for estimating absolute densities of field populations of animals have been widely used over the last century in both scientific studies and wildlife management programs. To date, two general classes of density estimation models have been developed: models that use data sets from capture–recapture or removal sampling techniques (often derived from trapping grids) from which separate estimates of population size (Nˆ ) and effective sampling area (Aˆ ) are used to calculate density (Dˆ 5Nˆ /Aˆ ); and models applicable to sampling regimes using distance-sampling theory (typically transect lines or trapping webs) to estimate detection functions and densities directly from the distance data. However, few studies have evaluated these respective models for accuracy, precision, and bias on known field populations, and no studies have been conducted that compare the two approaches under controlled field conditions. In this study, we evaluated both classes of density estimators on known densities of enclosed rodent populations. Test data sets (n 5 11) were developed using nine rodent species from capture–recapture live-trapping on both trapping grids and trapping webs in four replicate 4.2-ha enclosures on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, USA. Additional ‘‘saturation’’ trapping efforts resulted in an enumeration of the rodent populations in each enclosure, allowing the computation of true densities. Density estimates (Dˆ ) were calculated using program CAPTURE for the grid data sets and program DISTANCE for the web data sets, and these results were compared to the known true densities (D) to evaluate each model’s relative mean square error, accuracy, precision, and bias. In addition, we evaluated a variety of approaches to each data set’s analysis by having a group of independent expert analysts calculate their best density estimates without a priori knowledge of the true densities; this ‘‘blind’’ test allowed us to evaluate the influence of expertise and experience in calculating density estimates in comparison to simply using default values in programs CAPTURE and DISTANCE. While the rodent sample sizes were considerably smaller than the recommended minimum for good model results, we found that several models performed well empirically, including the web-based uniform and half-normal models in program DISTANCE, and the grid-based models Mb and Mbh in program CAPTURE (with Aˆ adjusted by species-specific full mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) values). These models produced accurate Dˆ values (with 95\% confidence intervals that included the true D values) and exhibited acceptable bias but poor precision. However, in linear regression analyses comparing each model’s Dˆ values to the true D values over the range of observed test densities, only the web-based uniform model exhibited a regression slope near 1.0; all other models showed substantial slope deviations, indicating biased estimates at higher or lower density values. In addition, the grid-based Dˆ analyses using full MMDM values for Wˆ area adjustments required a number of theoretical assumptions of uncertain validity, and we therefore viewed their empirical successes with caution. Finally, density estimates from the independent analysts were highly variable, but estimates from web-based approaches had smaller mean square errors and better achieved confidence-interval coverage of D than did grid-based approaches. Our results support the contention that web-based approaches for density estimation of small-mammal populations are both theoretically and empirically superior to grid-based approaches, even when sample size is far less than often recommended. In view of the increasing need for standardized environmental measures for comparisons among ecosystems and through time, analytical models based on distance sampling appear to offer accurate density estimation approaches for research studies involving small-mammal abundances.},

Continuous Eulerian models describe expected behaviour, averaged over stochastic realizations, and are usefully applied to ensembles of individuals. We illustrate three modern research arenas. (i) Models of home-range formation describe the process of an animal 'settling down', accomplished by including one or more focal points that attract the animal's movements. (ii) Memory-based models are used to predict how accumulated experience translates into biased movement choices, employing reinforced random walk behaviour, with previous visitation increasing or decreasing the probability of repetition. (iii) Lévy movement involves a step-length distribution that is over-dispersed, relative to standard probability distributions, and adaptive in exploring new environments or searching for rare targets. Each of these modelling arenas implies more detail in the movement pattern than general models of movement can accommodate, but realistic empiric evaluation of their predictions requires dense locational data, both in time and space, only available with modern GPS telemetry.},

The species was virtually isolated on remnants, making little use of the regenerating clearcuts surrounding the remnants. The effects of the clearcut also impinged on the remnants as edge effects: six times more voles were captured per trap in the interior of remnants than on the edge. Consequently, the density of voles per unit area on remnants increased with remnant size, despite the potential buildup of population density in small isolates due to limited emigration. I explored potential mechanisms of the negative edge effect on voles and found that the biomass of coarse woody debris, per se, did not explain the vole distribution because both number and volume of logs increased from the interior to the edge of remnants. However, the distribution of the vole's primary food item, hypogeous sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi, did correspond to the vole edge effect.},

The second is that each member of the population has the same probability of being available for detection in a given period.

Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models. Analysis of relocation data from elk released in east-central Ontario, Canada, suggests a biphasic movement behavior: elk are either in an ‘‘encamped’’ state in which step lengths are small and turning angles are high, or in an ‘‘exploratory’’ state, in which daily step lengths are several kilometers and turning angles are small. Animals encamp in open habitat (agricultural fields and opened forest), but the exploratory state is not associated with any particular habitat type.},

	abstract = {Unbiased estimation of population density is a major and unsolved problem in animal trapping studies. This paper describes a new and general method for estimating density from closed-population capture - recapture data. Many estimators exist for the size (N) and mean capture probability ((p) over bar) of a closed population. These statistics suffer from an unknown bias due to edge effect that varies with trap layout and home range size. The mean distance between successive captures of an individual ((d) over bar) provides information on the scale of individual movements, but is itself a function of trap spacing and grid size. Our aim is to define and estimate parameters that do not depend on the trap layout. In the new method, simulation and inverse prediction are used to estimate jointly the population density ( D) and two parameters of individual capture probability, magnitude (g(0)) and spatial scale (sigma), from the information in (N) over cap; (p) over bar and (d) over bar: The method uses any configuration of traps ( e. g. grid, web or line) and any choice of closed-population estimator. It is assumed that home ranges have a stationary distribution in two dimensions, and that capture events may be simulated as the outcome of competing Poisson processes in time. The method is applied to simulated and field data. The estimator appears unusually robust and free from biaswas not downloaded},

	abstract = {Mountain lions (Puma concolor) are often difficult to monitor because of their low capture probabilities, extensive movements, and large territories. Methods for estimating the abundance of this species are needed to assess population status, determine harvest levels, evaluate the impacts of management actions on populations, and derive conservation and management strategies. Traditional mark–recapture methods do not explicitly account for differences in individual capture probabilities due to the spatial distribution of individuals in relation to survey effort (or trap locations). However, recent advances in the analysis of capture–recapture data have produced methods estimating abundance and density of animals from spatially explicit capture–recapture data that account for heterogeneity in capture probabilities due to the spatial organization of individuals and traps. We adapt recently developed spatial capture–recapture models to estimate density and abundance of mountain lions in western Montana. Volunteers and state agency personnel collected mountain lionDNA samples in portions of the Blackfoot drainage (7,908 km2) in west- central Montana using 2 methods: snow back-tracking mountain lion tracks to collect hair samples and biopsy darting treed mountain lions to obtain tissue samples. Overall, we recorded 72 individual capture events, including captures both with and without tissue sample collection and hair samples resulting in the identification of 50 individual mountain lions (30 females, 19 males, and 1 unknown sex individual). We estimated lion densities from 8 models containing effects of distance, sex, and survey effort on detection probability. Our population density estimates ranged from a minimum of 3.7 mountain lions/100 km2 (95\% CI 2.3–5.7) under the distance only model (including only an effect of distance on detection probability) to 6.7 (95\% CI 3.1–11.0) under the full model (including effects of distance, sex, survey effort, and dis- tance ? sex on detection probability). These numbers translate to a total estimate of 293 mountain lions (95\% CI 182–451) to 529 (95\% CI 245–870) within the Blackfoot drainage. Results from the distancemodel are similar to previous estimates of 3.6 mountain lions/100 km2 for the study area; however, results from all other models indicated greater numbers of mountain lions. Our results indicate that unstructured spatial sampling combined with spatial capture–recapture analysis can be an effective method for estimating large carnivore densities. Published 2012.

State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broad- er-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation tech- niques, all under a single statistical framework.

We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

	abstract = {I describe a diffusion model aimed at the quantitative analysis of movement in heterogeneous landscapes. The model is based on classifying a landscape into a number of habitat types, which are assumed to differ from each other in terms of the movement behavior of the focal species. In addition to habitat-specific diffusion and mortality coefficients, the model accounts for edge-mediated behavior, meaning biased behavior close to boundaries between the habitat types. I illustrate the model with three examples. In the first example, I examine how the strength of edge-mediated behavior and the size of a habitat patch affect the probability that an individual will immigrate to a patch, the probability that an individual will emigrate from a patch, and the time that an individual is expected to spend in a patch. In the second example, I study how a dispersal corridor affects the probability that an individual will move through a landscape. In the third example, I estimate the movement parameters for a species of butterfly from mark-recapture data. In the butterfly examples I classify the landscape into habitat patches, other open areas, and forests. Edge-mediated behavior is found to have a highly significant effect on the general dispersal pattern of the butterfly: the model predicts that the density of butterflies inside habitat patches is {\textgreater}100 times the density of butterflies in adjacent areas.},

Likelihood-based methods provide estimates for data from multi-catch traps or from devices that record presence without restricting animal movement (‘‘proximity’’ detectors such as camera traps and hair snags). As originally proposed, these methods require multiple sampling intervals. We show that equally precise and unbiased estimates may be obtained from a single sampling interval, using only the spatial pattern of detections. This considerably extends the range of possible applications, and we illustrate the potential by estimating density from simulated detections of bird vocalizations on a microphone array. Acoustic detection can be defined as occurring when received signal strength exceeds a threshold. We suggest detection models for binary acoustic data, and for continuous data comprising measurements of all signals above the threshold. While binary data are often sufficient for density estimation, modeling signal strength improves precision when the microphone array is small.},

	abstract = {There is growing need to develop models of spatial patterns in animal abundance, yet comparatively few examples of such models exist. This is especially true in situations where the abundance of one species may inhibit that of another, such as the intensively-farmed landscape of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the central United States, where waterfowl production is largely constrained by mesocarnivore nest predation. We used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to relate the distribution of various land-cover types to the relative abundances of four mesocarnivores in the PPR: coyote Canis latrans, raccoon Procyon lotor, red fox Vulpes vulpes, and striped skunk Mephitis mephitis. We developed models for each species at multiple spatial resolutions (41.4 km2, 10.4 km2, and 2.6 km2) to address different ecological and management-related questions. Model results for each species were similar irrespective of resolution. We found that the amount of row-crop agriculture was nearly ubiquitous in our best models, exhibiting a positive relationship with relative abundance for each species. The amount of native grassland land-cover was positively associated with coyote and raccoon relative abundance, but generally absent from models for red fox and skunk. Red fox and skunk were positively associated with each other, suggesting potential niche overlap. We found no evidence that coyote abundance limited that of other mesocarnivore species, as might be expected under a hypothesis of mesopredator release. The relationships between relative abundance and land-cover types were similar across spatial resolutions. Our results indicated that mesocarnivores in the PPR are most likely to occur in portions of the landscape with large amounts of agricultural land-cover. Further, our results indicated that track-survey data can be used in a hierarchical framework to gain inferences regarding spatial patterns in animal relative abundance.},

	abstract = {Estimating densities of cougar (Puma concolor) is important for managing cougars and their prey but remains challenging because of cougar's elusive and solitary behavior. To evaluate a non-invasive, genetic capture–recapture method to estimate cougar population size and density, we surveyed a 220-km2 area using conservation detection dogs trained to locate scat over a 4-week sampling period in northeast Oregon. We collected 272 scat samples and conducted DNA analysis on 249 samples from which we determined individual identification from 73 samples that represented 21 cougars (9 males and 12 females). We evaluated 4 models to estimate cougar densities: Huggins closed population capture–recapture (Huggins), CAPWIRE, multiple detections with Poisson (MDP), and spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR). Population estimates for cougars using our study area were 26 (95\% CI = 22–35, 9 males and 17 females) from Huggins models, 24 (95\% CI = 21–30, 9 males and 15 females) from CAPWIRE, and 27 (95\% CI = 24–42, 9 males and 18 females) from the MDP model. We accounted for the edge effect in density estimates caused by individuals whose home ranges included only a portion of the survey grid by buffering the study area using the mean home range radius of 8 cougars equipped with global positioning system collars on or near the study area. We estimated densities of 4.6 cougars/100 km2 (95\% CI = 3.8–8.3) for the Huggins model, 4.8 cougars/100 km2 (95\% CI = 4.2–7.8) for the MDP model, 4.2 cougars/100 km2 (95\% CI = 3.3–5.3) for the CAPWIRE model, and 5.0 cougars/100 km2 (95\% CI = 3.2–7.7) for the SECR model. Our results suggested estimating cougar densities using scat detection dogs could be feasible at a broader scale with less effort than other methods currently being used. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {The number of animals in a population is conventionally estimated by capture–recapture without modelling the spatial relationships between animals and detectors. Problems arise with non‐spatial estimators when individuals differ in their exposure to traps or the target population is poorly defined. Spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) methods devised recently to estimate population density largely avoid these problems. Some applications require estimates of population size rather than density, and population size in a defined area may be obtained as a derived parameter from SECR models. While this use of SECR has potential benefits over conventional capture–recapture, including reduced bias, it is unfamiliar to field biologists and no study has examined the precision and robustness of the estimates. We used simulation to compare the performance of SECR and conventional estimators of population size with respect to bias and confidence interval coverage for several spatial scenarios. Three possible estimators for the sampling variance of realised population size all performed well. The precision of SECR estimates was nearly the same as that of the null‐model conventional population estimator. SECR estimates of population size were nearly unbiased (relative bias 0–10\%) in all scenarios, including surveys in randomly generated patchy landscapes. Confidence interval coverage was near the nominal level. We used SECR to estimate the population of a species of skink from pitfall trapping. The estimated number in the area bounded by the outermost traps differed little between a homogeneous density model and models with a quadratic trend in density or a habitat effect on density, despite evidence that the latter models fitted better. Extrapolation of trend models to a larger plot may be misleading. To avoid extrapolation, a large region of interest should be sampled throughout, either with one continuous trapping grid or with clusters of traps dispersed widely according to a probability‐based and spatially representative sampling design.},

In both sets of data, rates of detection appear to vary more among individuals (animals or species) than among sampling occasions or locations. The estimates of population size and species richness are sensitive to model-specific assumptions about the latent distribution of individual rates of detection. We demonstrate using simulation experiments that conventional diagnostics for assessing model adequacy, such as deviance, cannot be relied on for selecting classes of mixture models that produce valid inferences about population size. Prior knowledge about sources of individual heterogeneity in detection rates, if available, should be used to help select among classes of mixture models that are to be used for inference.},

We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species’ distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species’ occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species’ distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods.

	abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

We used genetic analysis to identify individual bears from hair samples collected via 2 concurrent sampling methods: 1) systematically distributed, baited, barbed-wire hair traps and 2) unbaited bear rub trees found along trails. We used Huggins closed mixture models in Program MARK to estimate total population size and developed a method to account for heterogeneity caused by unequal access to rub trees. We corrected our estimate for lack of geographic closure using a new method that utilizes information from radiocollared bears and the distribution of bears captured with DNA sampling. Adjusted for closure, the average number of grizzly bears in our study area was 240.7 (95\% CI 202-303) in 1998 and 240.6 (95\% CI 205-304) in 2000. Average grizzly bear density was 30 bears/1,000 km(2), with 2.4 times more bears detected per hair trap inside than outside GNP. We provide baseline information important for managing one of the few remaining populations of grizzlies in the contiguous United States. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 72(8): 1693-1705; 2008)},

	abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires decisions about the specifica- tion of the appropriate random-effects structure. Recently, Barr et al. (2013) recommended fitting ‘maximal’ models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too com- plex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are atyp- ical for real data. A detailed example is provided of how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

	abstract = {Conservation strategies for endangered species require accurate and precise estimates of abundance. Unfortunately, obtaining unbiased estimates can be difficult due to inappropriate estimator models and study design. We evaluate population–density estimators for tigers Panthera tigris in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India, using camera traps in conjunction with telemetry (n=6) in a known minimum population of 14 tigers. An effort of 462 trap nights over 42 days yielded 44 photographs of 12 adult tigers. Using closed population estimators, the best-fit model (program CAPTURE) accounted for individual heterogeneity (Mh). The least biased and precise population estimate ({\textasciicircum} n (SE)[{\textasciicircum} n]) was obtained by the Mh Jackknife 1 (JK1) [14 (1.89)] in program CARE-2. Tiger density ( {\textasciicircum} D (SE)[ {\textasciicircum} D]) per 100km2 was estimated at 13 (2.08) when the effective trapping area was estimated using the half mean maximum distance moved (1/2 MMDM), 8.1 (2.08), using the home-range radius, 7.8 (1.59), with the fullMMDMand 8.0 (3.0) with the spatial likelihood method in program DENSITY 4.1. The actual density of collared tigers (3.27 per 100km2) was closely estimated by home-range radius at 3.9 (0.76), full MMDM at 3.48 (0.81) and spatial likelihood at 3.78 (1.54), but overestimated by 1/2 MMDM at 6 (0.81) tigers per 100km2. Sampling costs (Rs. 450 per camera day) increased linearly with camera density, while the precision of population estimates leveled off at 25 cameras per 100km2. At simulated low tiger densities, a camera density of 50 per 100km2 with an effort of 8 trap nightskm?2 provided 95\% confidence coverage, but estimates lacked precision. Introduction},

These results suggest that only a third of the variation in cancer risk among tissues is attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions. The majority is due to "bad luck," that is, random mutations arising during DNA replication in normal, noncancerous stem cells.

Here, we review the three main steps of the approach: designing the appropriate sampling scheme, conducting the genetic lab analysis, and applying the CR analysis to the genetic results; and present a synthesis of this topic with the aim of discussing the primary limitations and sources of error. We discuss the importance of the integration between these steps, the unique situations which occur with non-invasive studies, the role of ecologists and geneticists throughout the process, the problem of error propagation, and the sources of biases which can be present in the final estimates.

Here we propose an alternative Bayesian approach that relies on a different parameterisation which imposes no assumption on the shape of F but drives the problem back to a finite-dimensional setting.

Yet, perhaps confused by the large number of statistical models and fitting methods available, many ecologists seem to believe this is best left to specialists. Here, we describe the issues that need consideration when analysing spatial data and illustrate these using simulation studies. Our comparative analysis involves using methods including generalized least squares, spatial filters, wavelet revised models, conditional autoregressive models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate regression coefficients from synthetic but realistic data sets, including some which violate standard regression assumptions. We assess the performance of each method using two measures and using statistical error rates for model selection. Methods that performed well included generalized least squares family of models and a Bayesian implementation of the conditional auto-regressive model. Ordinary least squares also performed adequately in the absence of model selection, but had poorly controlled Type I error rates and so did not show the improvements in performance under model selection when using the above methods. Removing large-scale spatial trends in the response led to poor performance. These are empirical results; hence extrapolation of these findings to other situations should be performed cautiously. Nevertheless, our simulation-based approach provides much stronger evidence for comparative analysis than assessments based on single or small numbers of data sets, and should be considered a necessary foundation for statements of this type in future.},

Climate has long been considered the primary broad-scale control on litter decomposition rates, yet recent work suggests that plant litter traits may predominate. Both decomposition paradigms, however, rely on inferences from cross-biome litter decomposition studies that analyse site-level means. 3. We re-analyse data from a classical cross-biome study to demonstrate that previous research may falsely inflate the regulatory role of climate on decomposition and mask the influence of unmeasured local-scale factors. 4. Using the re-analysis as a platform, we advocate experimental designs of litter decomposition studies that involve high within-site replication, measurements of regulatory factors and processes at the same local spatial grain, analysis of individual observations and biome-scale gradients. 5. Synthesis. We question the assumption that climate is the predominant regulator of decomposition rates at broad spatial scales. We propose a framework for a new generation of studies focused on factoring local-scale variation into the measurement and analysis of soil processes across broad scales. Such efforts may suggest a revised decomposition paradigm and ultimately improve confi- dence in the structure, parameter estimates and hence projections of biogeochemical models.},

The best sampling design to avoid pseudoreplication was the ‘‘additive method,’’ where the presence of a carcass, estimated by either a collection of scats or a carcass itself along the travel route of a wolf, was considered 1 sampling unit. Although roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were the primary prey used by wolves in the area, red deer (Cervus elaphus), recently reintroduced prey present at low density, were selected in winter 2001. We evaluated the optimal sample size for a given question using Monte Carlo simulations. At small sample sizes, slight increases in sample sizes caused large reductions in the standard error, greatly improving the precision of the estimates of percentage of items in the diet. Estimating the number of rare prey species used by wolves, such as red deer in our case study (,2\% of the diet estimates), was possible if the minimum sample size was greater than 10–40\% of the population of carcasses. We emphasized the importance of the additive method to improve the accuracy of estimates of diet selection by carnivores.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores in Italy and other European coun- tries are protected by law to ensure their long-term conserva- tion. Estimates of abundance and demographic trends of their populations are crucial for implementing effective conserva- tion and management strategies. However, it is challenging to obtain basic demographic parameters for elusive species such as the wolf (Canis lupus). Monitoring wolf populations by standard field methods or non-invasive genetic approaches requires huge human efforts and may be exceedingly expen- sive on a nation-wide scale. Aiming to obtain a first approxi- mate estimate of wolf distribution and abundance in Italy, we developed a systematic review procedure to analyze published data obtained from a variety of sources.We deduced relevant information on wolf presence and numbers from 20 peer- reviewed studies or official reports, and from 241 Standard Data Forms of Natura 2000 sites in Italy, referring to the pe- riod 2009–2013.We estimated the species abundance by com- bining the number of individuals reported in each study area with the values obtained by multiplying the estimated number of packs for the average pack size. Comparing our estimates with those previously reported, we evaluated the qualitative trend of the population for each of the twomanagement units: Alps and Apennines. Results showed the occurrence of ap- proximately 321 wolf packs in Italy, corresponding to 1269– 1800 wolves, possibly still underestimated. The Apennine sub-population seems to be almost the double in size (with ca. 1212–1711 wolves in the period 2009–2013) compared to previous estimates (600–800 wolves between 2006 and 2011). The Alpine sub-population, despite its ongoing eastwards ex- pansion, appears rather stable (with 57–89 wolves). Overall, the current wolf population size and trends seem favorable, although the species is still locally threatened by widespread poaching and accidents. These results represent the first esti- mate of abundance for the whole Italian wolf population in the last 40 years. Such information can be used to implement sound conservation strategies, especially in critical human- dominated landscapes, where conflicts with human activities and increasing rates of hybridizationwith free-ranging domes- tic dogs call for updated management plans.},

In species with sexually selected infanticide (SSI), hunting may decrease juvenile survival by increasing male turnover. We aimed to evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of hunting via SSI on the population dynamics of the Scandinavian brown bear (Ursus arctos). We performed prospective and retrospective demographic perturbation analyses for periods with low and high hunting pressures. All demographic rates, except yearling survival, were lower under high hunting pressure, which led to a decline in population growth under high hunting pressure (lambda = 0.975; 95\% CI = 0.914-1.011). Hunting had negative indirect effects on the population through an increase in SSI, which lowered cub survival and possibly also fecundity rates. Our study suggests that SSI could explain 13.6\% of the variation in population growth. Hunting also affected the relative importance of survival and fecundity of adult females for population growth, with fecundity being more important under low hunting pressure and survival more important under high hunting pressure. Our study sheds light on the importance of direct and indirect effects of hunting on population dynamics, and supports the contention that hunting can have indirect negative effects on populations through SSI.},

	abstract = {1. Reliable estimates of population parameters are often necessary for conservation management but these are hard to obtain for elusive, rare and wide-ranging species such as wolves Canis lupus. This species has naturally recolonized parts of its former habitat in Western Europe; however, an accurate and cost-effective method to assess population trend and survival has not been implemented yet. 2. We used open-model capture–recapture (CR) sampling with non-invasive individual identifications derived from faecal genotyping to estimate survival and trend in abundance for wolves in the Western Alps between 1999 and 2006. Our sampling strategy reduced individual heterogeneity in recaptures, thus minimizing bias and increasing the precision of the estimates. 3. Young wolves had lower apparent annual survival rates (0Æ24 ± 0Æ06) than adult wolves (0Æ82 ± 0Æ04); survival rates were lower in the summer than in the winter for both young and adults. The wolf population in the study area increased from 21 ± 9Æ6 wolves in 1999 to 47 ± 11Æ2 wolves in late winter 2005; the population growth rate (k = 1Æ04 ± 0Æ27) was lower than that recorded for other recolonizing wolf populations. 4. We found a positive trend in wolf abundance, regardless of the method used. However, the abundance estimate based on snow-tracking was on average 36Æ2\% (SD = 13Æ6\%) lower than that from CR modelling, because young dispersing wolves are likely to have lower sign detection rates in snow-track surveys, a problemadequately addressed byCRsampling. 5. Synthesis and applications. We successfully implemented a new method to assess large carnivore population trend and survival at large spatial scales. These are the first such estimates for wolves in Italy and in the Alps and have important management implications. Our approach can be widely applied to broader spatial and temporal scales for other elusive and wide-ranging species in Europe and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. A major paradigm shift is occurring in the approach of ecologists to statistical analysis. The use of the traditional approach of null-hypothesis testing has been questioned and an alternative, model selection by information–theoretic methods, has been strongly promoted and is now widely used. For certain types of analysis, information–theoretic approaches offer powerful and compelling advantages over null-hypothesis testing. 2. The benefits of information–theoretic methods are often framed as criticisms of null-hypothesis testing. We argue that many of these criticisms are neither irremediable nor always fair. Many are criticisms of the paradigm's application, rather than of its formulation. Information–theoretic methods are equally vulnerable to many such misuses. Care must be taken in the use of either approach but users of null-hypothesis tests, in particular, must greatly improve standards of reporting and interpretation. 3. Recent critiques have suggested that the distinction between experimental and observational studies defines the limits of the utility of null-hypothesis testing (with the paradigm being applicable to the former but not the latter). However, we believe that there are many situations in which observational data are collected that lend themselves to analysis under the null-hypothesis testing paradigm. We suggest that the applicability of the two analytical paradigms is more accurately defined by studies that assess univariate causality (when null-hypothesis testing is adequate) and those that assess multivariate patterns of causality (when information–theoretic methods are more suitable). 4. Synthesis and applications. Many ecologists are confused about the circumstances under which different inferential paradigms might apply. We address some of the major criticisms of the null-hypothesis testing paradigm, assess those criticisms in relation to the information–theoretic paradigm, propose methods for improving the use of null-hypothesis testing, and discuss situations in which the use of null-hypothesis testing would be appropriate. We urge instructors and practitioners of statistical methods to heighten awareness of the limitations of null-hypothesis testing and to use information–theoretic methods whenever prior evidence suggests that multiple research hypotheses are plausible. We contend, however, that by marginalizing the use of null-hypothesis testing, ecologists risk rejecting a powerful, informative and well-established analytical tool.},

I begin by providing a concise summary of Bayesian methods of analysis, including a comparison of differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference when using hierarchical models. Next I pro- vide a list of problems where Bayesian methods of analysis may arguably be preferred over frequentist methods. These problems are usually encountered in analyses based on hierarchical models of data. I describe the essentials required for applying modern methods of Bayesian com- putation, and I use real-world examples to illustrate these methods.

	abstract = {Home ranges of individuals of the gray four-eyed opossum Philander frenatus were studied by capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and radiotelemetry, within a set of eight Atlantic Forest fragments surrounded by a grassland matrix in the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Trapping sessions were carried out in all the forest fragments and in the grassland matrix. Adult individuals were fitted with radio-collar transmitters and monitored throughout the night. Locations were obtained by the "homing-in on the animal" method. Home-range sizes of the individuals with five or more captures or locations were estimated through the minimum convex polygon method. Home-range sizes estimated by radiotelemetry ranged from 0.6 to 7.4 ha (n=8), and by CMR ranged from 0.1 to 12.1 ha (n=17); home-range sizes estimated by radiotelemetry did not differ significantly from those based on CMR. However, comparing radiotelemetry with different CMR designs, the former estimates were larger than those based on either CMR using a single grid or CMR using two grids, but not larger than those based on multiple-grid CMR. In specific cases, animals monitored via radiotelemetry for only one or two nights showed larger home ranges than most individuals for which home ranges were estimated by CMR. Two individuals for which home-range sizes were estimated by both techniques showed larger home ranges when data from radiotelemetry were used. These data indicated that CMR can provide results comparable to radiotelemetry when multiple grids, spread across the landscape, are used, although this necessitates an intensive trapping effort. On the other hand, single- and double-grid CMR tend to underestimate home-ranges compared to radiotelemetry. © 2008 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

Just as body size is important to the physiology of an individual animal, colony size correlates with the life-history and ecology of social insects. Although nest excavation and counting all individuals is the most accurate method for estimating colony size (or nest size), it has the major drawback of being destructive. Alternatively, mark–release–recapture (MRR) can be used repeatedly to measure the size of the same colony or nest. We compared the accuracy and feasibility of four MRR methods and a Mound-Volume method with complete counts from nest excavation for estimating the nest size of F. lugubris, a mound-building wood ant of the Formica rufa group, during the early spring in Scotland. We found that our After-Disturbing method, in which we performed marking and recapturing after gentle disturbance to the top of nest mound, has the best balance between accuracy, non-destructiveness, and time required. We also found that mound volume can be an index of ant nest size under certain conditions. Both non-destructive methods can be used on the same colony or nest repeatedly to monitor nest dynamics.},

Brown bear faecal DNA extracts of varying quality (n = 33) and hair DNA extracts of poor (n = 32) and good (n = 34) quality were used to compare standard PCR and pre-amplification. In contrast to previous studies, there was no significant difference between methods for individual locus amplification success, genotyping error and genotyping success rates for scat and hair samples. The use of pre-amplification requires an additional investment of time and resources, and our results raise questions about the universal value of pre-amplification approaches.

	abstract = {Knowledge of population demographics is important for species management but can be challenging in low-density, wide-ranging species. Population monitoring of the endangered Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis) is critical for assessing the success of recovery efforts, and noninvasive DNA sampling (NDS) could be more cost-effective and less intrusive than traditional methods. We evaluated faecal pellet deposition rates and faecal DNA degradation rates to maximize sampling efficiency for DNA-based mark-recapture analyses. Deposition data was collected at five watering holes using sampling intervals of one to seven days and averaged one pellet pile per pronghorn per day. To evaluate nuclear DNA (nDNA) degradation, 20 faecal samples were exposed to local environmental conditions and sampled at eight time points from one to 124 days. Average amplification success rates for six nDNA microsatellite loci were 81\% for samples on day one, 63\% by day seven, 2\% by day 14 and 0\% by day 60. We evaluated the efficiency of different sampling intervals (1-10 days) by estimating the number of successful samples, success rate of individual identification, and laboratory costs per successful sample. Cost per successful sample increased and success and efficiency declined as the sampling interval increased. Results indicate NDS of faecal pellets is a feasible method for individual identification, population estimation, and demographic monitoring of Sonoran pronghorn. We recommend collecting samples less than seven days old and estimate that a sampling interval of four to seven days in summer conditions (i.e., extreme heat and exposure to UV light) will achieve desired sample sizes for mark-recapture analysis while also maximizing efficiency.

	abstract = {Noninvasive genetic sampling of faecal pellets can be a valuable method for monitoring rare and cryptic wildlife populations, like the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis). To investigate this method's efficiency for pygmy rabbit monitoring, we evaluated the effect of sample age on DNA degradation in faecal pellets under summer field conditions. We placed 275 samples from known individuals in natural field conditions for 1-60 days and assessed DNA quality by amplifying a 294-base-pair (bp) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) locus and five nuclear DNA (nDNA) microsatellite loci (111-221 bp). DNA degradation was influenced by sample age, DNA type, locus length and rabbit sex. Both mtDNA and nDNA exhibited high PCR success rates (94.4\%) in samples {\textless}1 day old. Success rates for microsatellite loci declined rapidly from 80.0\% to 42.7\% between days 5 and 7, likely due to increased environmental temperature. Success rates for mtDNA amplification remained higher than nDNA over time, with moderate success (66.7\%) at 21 days. Allelic dropout rates were relatively high (17.6\% at {\textless}1 day) and increased to 100\% at 60 days. False allele rates ranged from 0 to 30.0\% and increased gradually over time. We recommend collecting samples as fresh as possible for individual identification during summer field conditions.

	doi = {10.1111/1755-0998.12250},
	abstract = {Noninvasive sampling, of faeces and hair for example, has enabled many genetic studies of wildlife populations. However, two prevailing problems common to these studies are small sample sizes and high genotyping errors. The first problem stems from the difficulty in collecting noninvasive samples, particularly from populations of rare or elusive species, and the second is caused by the low quantity and quality of DNA extracted from a noninvasive sample. A common question is therefore whether noninvasive sampling provides sufficient information for the analyses commonly conducted in conservation genetics studies. Here, we conducted a simulation study to investigate the effect of small sample sizes and genotyping errors on the precision and accuracy of the most commonly estimated genetic parameters. Our results indicate that small sample sizes cause little bias in measures of expected heterozygosity, pairwise FST and population structure, but a large downward bias in estimates of allelic diversity. Allelic dropouts and false alleles had a much smaller effect than missing data, which effectively reduces sample size further. Overall, reasonable estimates of genetic variation and population subdivision are obtainable from noninvasive samples as long as error rates are kept below a frequency of 0.2. Similarly, unbiased estimates of population clustering can be made with genotyping error rates below 0.5 when the populations are highly differentiated. These results provide a useful guide for researchers faced with studying the conservation genetics of small, endangered populations from noninvasive samples.},

This approach encompasses 79 fish and lamprey species native to Central European freshwater and enables the identification of 31 species, six genera, two families, two orders, and two fish family clusters. All targeted taxa were successfully amplified from 25 template molecules and each assay was specific when tested against a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates inhabiting aquatic environments. The applicability of the multiplex PCR system was evaluated in a feeding trial, wherein it outperformed morphological prey analysis regarding species-specific prey identification in feces of Eurasian otters. Additionally, a wide spectrum of fish species was detected in field-collected fecal samples and regurgitated pellets of Common Kingfishers and Great Cormorants, demonstrating the broad applicability of the approach. In conclusion, this multiplex PCR system provides an efficient, easy to use, and cost-effective tool for assessing the trophic ecology of piscivores in Central Europe. Additionally, the multiplex PCRs and the primers described therein will be applicable wherever DNA of the targeted fish species needs to be detected at high sensitivity and specificity.

Using PCR amplification of specific prey DNA with species-specific primers, we developed a DNA-based method that complements HPA and provides an alternative means to detect prey from stomach contents of Harp Seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus). The target size that could be reliably amplified was determined using a digestion time-series of Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) tissue in simulated seal stomachs. Various target lengths were trialed using general teleost primers; amplicons of approximately 800 bp or less were consistently obtained. Prey species-specific PCR primers for Atlantic Cod, Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida) and Capelin (Mallotus villosus) were designed and tested with DNA from the stomach contents of 31 Harp Seals. Amplicons were obtained for all three species-specific primer sets. Amplification results compared with HPA revealed: (i) Atlantic Cod hard parts were found in five stomachs where no Atlantic Cod DNA amplified, suggesting that Atlantic Cod may be over-represented in the estimated diet, (ii) amplification of Arctic Cod DNA occurred for 17 stomachs, including all 12 stomachs with, and five stomachs without, Arctic Cod hard parts, and (iii) Capelin DNA amplified for four of five stomachs with Capelin hard parts and for one stomach without Capelin hard parts. We conclude that PCR amplification of specific prey DNA provides a viable means to complement Harp Seal diet analysis by HPA, but suggest that valuable information for quantitative diet analysis rests in a quantitative PCR approach.},

	abstract = {Amphibians are currently the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide and introduced fauna play a major role in their decline. The control of introduced predators to protect endangered species is often based on predation rates derived from diet studies of predators, but prey detection probabilities using different techniques are variable. We measured the detectability of frogs as prey, using morphological and DNA-based diet analyses, in the stomachs and faeces of four mammal species that have been introduced to many areas of the world. Frogs (Litoria raniformis) were fed to rats (Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus), mice (Mus musculus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). DNA-based analysis outperformed morphological analysis, increasing the prey detection rate from 2 to 70\% in stomachs and from 0 to 53\% in faeces. In most cases, utilising either stomachs or faeces did not affect the success of prey DNA detection, however, using faeces extended the detectability half-life from 7 to 21 hours. This study is the first to measure prey DNA detection periods in mammalian stomachs, and the first to compare prey DNA detection periods in the stomachs and faeces of vertebrates. The results indicate that DNA-based diet analysis provides a more reliable approach for detecting amphibians as prey and has the potential to be used to estimate the rate of predation by introduced mammals on endangered amphibians.

	abstract = {Species identification through noninvasive sampling is increasingly used in animal conservation genetics, given that it obviates the need to handle free-living individuals. Noninvasive sampling is particularly valuable for elusive and small species such as rodents. Although rodents are not usually assumed to be the most obvious target for conservation, of the 21 species or near-species present in Iberia, three are considered endangered and declining, while several others are poorly studied. Here, we develop a genetic tool for identifying all rodent species in Iberia by noninvasive genetic sampling. To achieve this purpose, we selected one mitochondrial gene [cytochrome b (cyt-b)] and one nuclear gene [interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP)], which we first sequenced using tissue samples. Both genes allow for the phylogenetic distinction of all species except the sibling species Microtus lusitanicus and Microtus duodecimcostatus. Overall, cyt-b showed higher resolution than IRBP, revealing a clear barcoding gap. To allow these markers to be applied to noninvasive samples, we selected a short highly diagnostic fragment from each gene, which we used to obtain sequences from faeces and bones from owl pellets. Amplification success for the cyt-b and IRBP fragment was 85\% and 43\% in faecal and 88\% and 64\% in owl-pellet DNA extractions, respectively. The method allows the unambiguous identification of the great majority of Iberian rodent species from noninvasive samples, with application in studies of distribution, spatial ecology and population dynamics, and for conservation.},

We developed a method based on DNA metabarcoding multiplexing and next-generation sequencing to uncover different taxonomic groups of organisms from complex diet samples. We validated this approach on 91 faeces of a large omnivorous mammal, the brown bear, using DNA metabarcoding markers targeting the plant, vertebrate and invertebrate components of the diet. We included internal controls in the experiments and performed PCR replication for accuracy validation in postsequencing data analysis. Using our multiplexing strategy, we significantly simplified the experimental procedure and accurately and concurrently identified different prey DNA corresponding to the targeted taxonomic groups, with ≥ 60\% of taxa of all diet components identified to genus/species level. The systematic application of internal controls and replication was a useful and simple way to evaluate the performance of our experimental procedure, standardize the selection of sequence filtering parameters for each marker data and validate the accuracy of the results. Our general approach can be adapted to the analysis of dietary samples of various predator species in different ecosystems, for a number of conservation and ecological applications entailing large-scale population level diet assessment through cost-effective screening of multiple DNA metabarcodes, and the detection of fine dietary variation among samples or individuals and of rare food items.},

The great morphological similarities with three other sympatric brocket deer species, coupled with the fact that they inhabit densely forested habitats complicate detection and prevent the use of traditional methodologies for accurate identification of species. The ability to determine the presence of this endangered species in an area is crucial for estimating its distribution range, and is critical for establishing conservation management strategies. Here we describe a fast and reliable noninvasive genetic method for species identification of Mazama species from faeces. We designed a primer set that amplifies a short 224-bp fragment of the cytochrome b and demonstrate its effectiveness in successful amplification of DNA isolated from both tissue and faecal samples. This fragment contains a BSTNI/ECORII digestion site that is unique to the endangered M. bororo. The digested polymerase chain reaction products yielded a 160-bp fragment that is clearly visible in a 2\% agarose gel. Two other diagnostic sites were identified to differentiate the other three sympatric species, SspI (M. gouazoubira) and AflIII (M. americana, and M. nana).},

Samples obtained in the tropics are often exposed to high humidity, warm temperatures, frequent rain and intense sunlight, all of which can rapidly degrade DNA. Despite these potential problems, we demonstrate successful mtDNA amplification and sequencing for faeces of carnivores collected in tropical conditions and quantify how sample condition and environmental variables influence the success of PCR amplification and species identification. Additionally, the feasibility of genotyping nuclear microsatellites from jaguar (Panthera onca) faeces was investigated. From October 2007 to December 2008, 93 faecal samples were collected in the southern Brazilian Amazon. A total of eight carnivore species was successfully identified from 71\% of all samples obtained. Information theoretic analysis revealed that the number of PCR attempts before a successful sequence was an important negative predictor across all three responses (success of species identification, success of species identification from the first sequence and PCR amplification success), whereas the relative importance of the other three predictors (sample condition, season and distance from forest edge) varied between the three responses. Nuclear microsatellite amplification from jaguar faeces had lower success rates (15-44\%) compared with those of the mtDNA marker. Our results show that DNA obtained from faecal samples works efficiently for carnivore species identification in the Amazon forest and also shows potential for nuclear DNA analysis, thus providing a valuable tool for genetic, ecological and conservation studies.},

	abstract = {Although species assignment of scats is important to study carnivore biology, there is still no standardized assay for the identification of carnivores worldwide, which would allow large-scale routine assessments and reliable cross-comparison of results. Here, we evaluate the potential of two short mtDNA fragments [ATP6 (126 bp) and cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) (187 bp)] to serve as standard markers for the Carnivora. Samples of 66 species were sequenced for one or both of these segments. Alignments were complemented with archival sequences and analysed with three approaches (tree-based, distance-based and character-based). Intraspecific genetic distances were generally lower than between-species distances, resulting in diagnosable clusters for 86\% (ATP6) and 85\% (COI) of the species. Notable exceptions were recently diverged species, most of which could still be identified using diagnostic characters and uniqueness of haplotypes or by reducing the geographic scope of the comparison. In silico analyses were also performed for a 110-bp cytochrome b (cytb) segment, whose identification success was lower (70\%), possibly due to the smaller number of informative sites and/or the influence of misidentified sequences obtained from GenBank. Finally, we performed case studies with faecal samples, which supported the suitability of our two focal markers for poor-quality DNA and allowed an assessment of prey DNA co-amplification. No evidence of prey DNA contamination was found for ATP6, while some cases were observed for COI and subsequently eliminated by the design of more specific primers. Overall, our results indicate that these segments hold good potential as standard markers for accurate species-level identification in the Carnivora.},

	abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is a powerful new tool allowing characterization of species assemblages using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. The utility of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying relative species abundances is currently limited by both biological and technical biases which influence sequence read counts. We tested the idea of sequencing 50/50 mixtures of target species and a control species in order to generate relative correction factors (RCFs) that account for multiple sources of bias and are applicable to field studies. RCFs will be most effective if they are not affected by input mass ratio or co-occurring species. In a model experiment involving three target fish species and a fixed control, we found RCFs did vary with input ratio but in a consistent fashion, and that 50/50 RCFs applied to DNA sequence counts from various mixtures of the target species still greatly improved relative abundance estimates (e.g., average per species error of 19 ± 8\% for uncorrected versus 3 ± 1\% for corrected estimates). To demonstrate the use of correction factors in a field setting, we calculated 50/50 RCFs for 18 harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) prey species (RCFs ranging from 0.68 to 3.68). Applying these corrections to field-collected seal scats affected species percentages from individual samples (Δ 6.7 ± 6.6\%) more than population level species estimates (Δ 1.7 ± 1.2\%). Our results indicate that the 50/50 RCF approach is an effective tool for evaluating and correcting biases in DNA metabarcoding studies. The decision to apply correction factors will be influenced by the feasibility of creating tissue mixtures for the target species, and the level of accuracy needed to meet research objectives.

This situation is, to a large extent, a result of human activity. The small populations of this subspecies are restricted to a few areas in the Arabian Peninsula, Israel and Jordan. Information required for conservation of this subspecies, including reliable population estimates and the range of individuals, is currently unavailable. To estimate population size and assign gender to individuals in the population in Israel we used molecular markers in leopard DNA extracted from scats collected in intensive surveys throughout the Judean Desert and the Negev Highlands. This non-invasive mode of sampling, combined with the availability of high-resolution markers (microsatellites) and sex-specific DNA-sequences, was successful in identifying both individuals and gender. The results indicated the existence of a male and two females in the Judean Desert, and four males and one female in the Negev Highlands. Although the non-invasive procedure we used may underestimate the leopard’s true population size, continuous monitoring of population size and sex composition of this small population using scatology is a key component for the management of this species. These data, especially if used in conjunction with similar data from other countries within the subspecies’ range, will assist in the establishment of conservation plans for the Arabian leopard.},

Additionally, we tested their reliability for species and individual identification using DNA from faeces of wild felids detected by a scat detector dog across Belize in Central America. All microsatellite loci were successfully amplified in the three target species, were polymorphic with average expected heterozygosities of HE   = 0.60 ± 0.18 (SD) for jaguars, HE   = 0.65 ± 0.21 (SD) for pumas and HE   = 0.70 ± 0.13 (SD) for ocelots and had an overall PCR amplification success of 61\%. We used this nuclear DNA primer set to successfully identify species and individuals from 49\% of 1053 field-collected scat samples. This set of optimized microsatellite multiplexes represents a powerful tool for future efforts to conduct noninvasive studies on multiple, wild Neotropical felids.},

However, potential biases associated with this approach are only beginning to be examined. We sequenced DNA amplified from faeces (scats) of captive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) to investigate whether sequence counts could be used to quantify the seals' diet. Seals were fed fish in fixed proportions, a chordate-specific mitochondrial 16S marker was amplified from scat DNA and amplicons sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM™. For a given set of bioinformatic parameters, there was generally low variability between scat samples in proportions of prey species sequences recovered. However, proportions varied substantially depending on sequencing direction, level of quality filtering (due to differences in sequence quality between species) and minimum read length considered. Short primer tags used to identify individual samples also influenced species proportions. In addition, there were complex interactions between factors; for example, the effect of quality filtering was influenced by the primer tag and sequencing direction. Resequencing of a subset of samples revealed some, but not all, biases were consistent between runs. Less stringent data filtering (based on quality scores or read length) generally produced more consistent proportional data, but overall proportions of sequences were very different than dietary mass proportions, indicating additional technical or biological biases are present. Our findings highlight that quantitative interpretations of sequence proportions generated via high-throughput sequencing will require careful experimental design and thoughtful data analysis.},

However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) success rates usually are lower, and genotyping errors higher than in standard population genetic surveys, due to DNA degradation or contamination in aged field samples. In this study, we evaluate the results of common garden experiments showing that DNA degradation is significant in wolf (Canis lupus) scats older than 3 days, and it is enhanced in scats in direct contact with soil. A storage test showed that samples kept frozen in 95\% ethanol performed better compared to other methods. However, variance of PCR success among samples was high, independent on sample age or storage condition. The detrimental consequences of DNA degradation can be avoided by collecting scat samples as fresh as possible, and implementing efficient multitube procedures and stringent quality control of the laboratory results. Efficient multitube procedures can produce reliable data, like in this study, which showed that the consensus genotypes obtained from excremental DNA exactly matched distinct reference genotypes obtained from wolf blood samples. 2007 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The koala, an Australian icon, has been added to the threatened species list. Rationale for the listing includes proposed declines in population size, threats to populations (e.g. disease) and loss and fragmentation of habitat. There is now an urgent need to obtain accurate data to assess the status of koala populations in Australia, to ensure the long-term viability of this species. Advances in genetic techniques have enabled DNA analysis to study and inform the management of wild populations; however, sampling of individual koalas is difficult in tall, often remote, eucalypt forest. The collection of faecal pellets (scats) from the forest floor presents an opportunistic sampling strategy, where DNA can be collected without capturing or even sighting an individual. Obtaining DNA via noninvasive sampling can be used to rapidly sample a large proportion of a population; however, DNA from noninvasively collected samples is often degraded. Factors influencing DNA quality and quantity include environmental exposure, diet and methods of sample collection, storage and DNA isolation. Reduced DNA quality and quantity can introduce genotyping errors and provide inaccurate DNA profiles, reducing confidence in the ability of such data to inform management/conservation strategies. Here, we present a protocol that produces a reliable individual koala genotype from a single faecal pellet and highlight the importance of optimizing DNA isolation and analysis for the species of interest. This method could readily be adapted for genetic studies of mammals other than koalas, particularly those whose diet contains high proportions of volatile materials that are likely to induce DNA damage.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive genetic sampling, or noninvasive DNA sampling (NDS), can be an effective monitoring approach for elusive, wide-ranging species at low densities. However, few studies have attempted to maximize sampling efficiency. We present a model for combining sample accumulation and DNA degradation to identify the most efficient (i.e. minimal cost per successful sample) NDS temporal design for capture-recapture analyses. We use scat accumulation and faecal DNA degradation rates for two sympatric carnivores, kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) and coyote (Canis latrans) across two seasons (summer and winter) in Utah, USA, to demonstrate implementation of this approach. We estimated scat accumulation rates by clearing and surveying transects for scats. We evaluated mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) DNA amplification success for faecal DNA samples under natural field conditions for 20 fresh scats/species/season from {\textless}1-112 days. Mean accumulation rates were nearly three times greater for coyotes (0.076 scats/km/day) than foxes (0.029 scats/km/day) across seasons. Across species and seasons, mtDNA amplification success was ≥95\% through day 21. Fox nDNA amplification success was ≥70\% through day 21 across seasons. Coyote nDNA success was ≥70\% through day 21 in winter, but declined to {\textless}50\% by day 7 in summer. We identified a common temporal sampling frame of approximately 14 days that allowed species to be monitored simultaneously, further reducing time, survey effort and costs. Our results suggest that when conducting repeated surveys for capture-recapture analyses, overall cost-efficiency for NDS may be improved with a temporal design that balances field and laboratory costs along with deposition and degradation rates.},

	abstract = {Monitoring large carnivores is difficult because of intrinsically low densities and can be dangerous if physical capture is required. Noninvasive genetic sampling (NGS) is a safe and cost-effective alternative to physical capture. We evaluated the utility of two NGS methods (scat detection dogs and hair sampling) to obtain genetic samples for abundance estimation of coyotes, black bears and Canada lynx in three areas of Newfoundland, Canada. We calculated abundance estimates using program capwire, compared sampling costs, and the cost/sample for each method relative to species and study site, and performed simulations to determine the sampling intensity necessary to achieve abundance estimates with coefficients of variation (CV) of {\textless}10\%. Scat sampling was effective for both coyotes and bears and hair snags effectively sampled bears in two of three study sites. Rub pads were ineffective in sampling coyotes and lynx. The precision of abundance estimates was dependent upon the number of captures/individual. Our simulations suggested that {\textasciitilde}3.4 captures/individual will result in a {\textless} 10\% CV for abundance estimates when populations are small (23-39), but fewer captures/individual may be sufficient for larger populations. We found scat sampling was more cost-effective for sampling multiple species, but suggest that hair sampling may be less expensive at study sites with limited road access for bears. Given the dependence of sampling scheme on species and study site, the optimal sampling scheme is likely to be study-specific warranting pilot studies in most circumstances.},

We conducted a captive feeding trial to test whether prey DNA could be reliably detected in scat samples from Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus). Two sea lions were fed a diet of fish (five species) and squid (one species), and DNA was extracted from the soft component of collected scats. Most of the DNA obtained came from the predator, but prey DNA could be amplified using prey-specific primers. The four prey species fed in consistent daily proportions throughout the trial were detected in more than 90\% of the scat DNA extractions. Squid and sockeye salmon, which were fed as a relatively small percentage of the daily diet, were detected as reliably as the more abundant diet items. Prey detection was erratic in scats collected when the daily diet was fed in two meals that differed in prey composition, suggesting that prey DNA is passed in meal specific pulses. Prey items that were removed from the diet following one day of feeding were only detected in scats collected within 48 h of ingestion. Proportions of fish DNA present in eight scat samples (evaluated through the screening of clone libraries) were roughly proportional to the mass of prey items consumed, raising the possibility that DNA quantification methods could provide semi-quantitative diet composition data. This study should be of broad interest to researchers studying diet since it highlights an approach that can accurately identify prey species and is not dependent on prey hard parts surviving digestion.},

We used molecular tools to analyse predator saliva, scat and hair from caribou calf kills in Newfoundland, Canada to identify the predator species, individual and sex. We sampled DNA from 32 carcasses using cotton swabs to collect predator saliva. We used fragment length analysis and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA to distinguish between coyote, black bear, Canada lynx and red fox and used nuclear DNA microsatellite analysis to identify individuals. We compared predator species detected using molecular tools to those assigned via field observations at each kill. We identified a predator species at 94\% of carcasses using molecular methods, while observational methods assigned a predator species to 62.5\% of kills. Molecular methods attributed 66.7\% of kills to coyote and 33.3\% to black bear, while observations assigned 40\%, 45\%, 10\% and 5\% to coyote, bear, lynx and fox, respectively. Individual identification was successful at 70\% of kills where a predator species was identified. Only one individual was identified at each kill, but some individuals were found at multiple kills. Predator sex was predominantly male. We demonstrate the first large-scale evaluation of predator species, individual and sex identification using molecular techniques to extract DNA from swabs of wild prey carcasses.

We further developed and validated a real-time PCR technique using species-specific mitochondrial DNA primers to quantify the proportion of prey in the diets of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), a pinniped species thought to be facing significant diet related challenges in the North Pacific. We first demonstrated that the proportions of prey tissue DNA in mixtures of DNA isolated from four prey species could be estimated within a margin of ∼ 12\% of the percent in the mix. These prey species included herring Clupea palasii, eulachon Thaleichthyes pacificus, squid Loligo opalescens and rosethorn rockfish Sebastes helvomaculatus. We then applied real-time PCR to DNA extracted from faecal samples obtained from Steller sea lions in captivity that were fed 11 different combinations of herring, eulachon, squid and Pacific ocean perch rockfish (Sebastes alutus), ranging from 7\% to 75\% contributions per meal (by wet weight). The difference between the average percentage estimated by real-time PCR and the percentage of prey consumed was generally {\textless}12\% for all diets fed.

However, our understanding of such implications has been traditionally hampered by both high genetic similarity and the difficulties in obtaining tissue samples (TS), which limit our ability to assess ongoing hybridization events. To assess the occurrence and extension of hybridization in a pack of wolf-dog hybrids in northwestern Iberia, we compared the power of 52 nuclear markers implemented on TS with a subset of 13 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) typed in noninvasive samples (NIS). We demonstrate that the 13 AIMs are as accurate as the 52 markers that were chosen without regard to the power to differentiate between wolves and dogs, also having the advantage of being rapidly screened on NIS. The efficiency of AIMs significantly outperformed ten random sets of similar size and an additional commercial set of 18 markers. Bayesian clustering analysis implemented on AIMs and NIS identified nine hybrids, two wolves and two dogs. Four hybrids were unambiguously assigned to F1xWolf backcrosses. Our approach (AIMs + NIS) overcomes previous difficulties related to sample availability and informative power of markers, allowing a quick identification of wolf-dog hybrids in the first phases of hybridization episodes. This provides managers with a reliable tool to evaluate hybridization and estimate the success of their actions. This approach may be easily adapted for other pairs of wild/domesticated species, thus improving our understanding of the introgression of domestication genes into natural populations.},

	abstract = {North African ungulates include several threatened and emblematic species, yet are poorly studied mainly due to their remoteness and elusiveness. Noninvasive sampling provides a useful approach to obtain ecological and genetic information essential to guide conservation actions. The very first and most important step in conservation planning is to accurately identify species and molecular genetics has proven to be a useful tool. Several molecular genetics protocols are available for species identification, even for samples with poor quality DNA, such as faeces, hairs or bones. Most of these protocols use mitochondrial DNA for barcoding despite this marker being especially prone to problems, including mtDNA introgression, nuclear insert copies, high intraspecific diversity, or heteroplasmy. In this work we developed a molecular method based on polymorphisms in small fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb, mtDNA) and the nuclear kappa casein genes (KCAS, nDNA) for identifying endangered North African ungulates. These fragments revealed polymorphisms, including species-specific variation, which allowed species identification of nine ungulate species that co-occur in North Africa. The method was validated across more than 400 samples, including different types of noninvasive samples collected in the field. The simplicity, high reliability and relative low cost of the described method make it a promising tool to improve ecological studies of the North African ungulates and consequently the implementation of more efficient management and conservation plans for these endangered ungulates.

We carefully selected an optimised final set of 96 SNPs (and discarded the worse half), based on assay performance and reliability. We found rates of missing data in this SNP set of {\textless}10\% and genotyping error of {\textasciitilde}1\%, which improves genotyping accuracy by nearly an order of magnitude when compared to published data for other marker types. Our approach provides a tool for rapid and cost-effective genotyping of noninvasively collected wildlife samples.

Recently developed spatial capture–recapture (SCR) methods are well suited to standard herpetofauna monitoring approaches. Individually identifying animals and their locations allows accurate estimates of population densities and survival. Spatial capture–recapture methods also allow estimation of parameters describing space-use and movement, which generally are expensive or difficult to obtain using other methods. In this paper, we discuss the basic components of SCR models, the available software for conducting analyses, and the experimental designs based on common herpetological survey methods. We then apply SCR models to Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus), to determine differences in density, survival, dispersal, and space-use between adult male and female salamanders. By highlighting the capabilities of SCR, and its advantages compared to traditional methods, we hope to give herpetologists the resource they need to apply SCR in their own systems.},

	abstract = {scales are still poorly understood. 2. Here, we investigated the patterns of damage caused by brown bears Ursus arctos and its ecological and socio-economic correlates at a continental scale. We compiled information about compensation schemes across 26 countries in Europe in 2005–2012 and analysed the variation in the number of compensated claims in relation to (i) bear abundance, (ii) forest availability, (iii) human land use, (iv) management practices and (v) indicators of economic wealth. 3. Most European countries have a posteriori compensation schemes based on damage verifi- cation, which, in many cases, have operated for more than 30 years. On average, over 3200 claims of bear damage were compensated annually in Europe. The majority of claims were for damage to livestock (59\%), distributed throughout the bear range, followed by damage to apiaries (21\%) and agriculture (17\%), mainly in Mediterranean and eastern European countries. 4. The mean number of compensated claims per bear and year ranged from 0?1 in Estonia to 8?5 in Norway. This variation was not only due to the differences in compensation schemes; damage claims were less numerous in areas with supplementary feeding and with a high proportion of agricultural land. However, observed variation in compensated damage was not related to bear abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Compensation schemes, management practices and human land use influence the number of claims for brown bear damage, while bear abundance does not. Policies that ignore this complexity and focus on a single factor, such as bear population size, may not be effective in reducing claims. To be effective, policies should be based on integra- tive schemes that prioritize damage prevention and make it a condition of payment of com- pensation that preventive measures are applied. Such integrative schemes should focus mitigation efforts in areas or populations where damage claims are more likely to occur. Sim- ilar studies using different species and continents might further improve our understanding of conflicts arising from wildlife damage.},

	abstract = {Local perceptions of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) numbers in southwestern Alberta, Canada are incongruent with their threatened status. We used non-invasive genetic sampling to estimate grizzly bear density and abundance in southwestern Alberta. We established 899 bear rub objects (e.g., tree, power pole, fence post) for hair sample collection across the study area by surveying trail networks, using geographic information system layers, and working with {\textgreater}70 landowners to identify priority sampling areas. The study area included 2 management zones: the Recovery Zone where the objective was to recover the grizzly bear population, and a Support Zone intended to maintain those bears not exclusively within the Recovery Zone. We visited rub objects every 3 weeks from late May through early November for 8 visits (7 sampling occasions) per field season. We also allowed for opportunistically collected hair samples (e.g., trapped bears, hair at agricultural bear-conflict sites). We identified species, individual identity, and sex based on nuclear DNA extracted from hair follicles. From 2013 through 2014, we identified 164 individual grizzly bears. Using spatially explicit capture–recapture models (SECR), we estimated density in 2 ways. First, we estimated density for each sex and year separately (2013: M = 9.2/1,000 km2 in the Recovery Zone and 8.1/1,000 km2 in the Support Zone, F = 14.9/1,000 km2 in the Recovery Zone and 13.6/1,000 km2 in the Support Zone; 2014: M = 7.2/1,000 km2 in the Recovery Zone and 5.7/1,000 km2 in the Support Zone, F = 9.0/1,000 km2 in the Recovery Zone and 8.5/1,000 km2 in the Support Zone). Second, we did not allow density to vary across years and instead estimated a single density for the study area (M = 8.0/1,000 km2 in the Recovery Zone and 7.1/1,000 km2 in the Support Zone, F = 12.4/1,000 km2 in the Recovery Zone and 10.0/1,000 km2 in the Support Zone). Though yearly variation occurred, we derived from our density estimates an expected abundance of approximately 67.4 resident grizzly bears, indicating a 4\% per year increase since a 2007 estimate of 51 bears. These SECR density estimates pertain only to bears with home ranges that were centered within the study area. Using traditional capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models with the same data yielded a higher estimate of bears because it included all bears that were using the study area (2013: F = 68.9, M = 102.6; 2014: F = 63.0, M = 108.6), including {\textgreater}50\% of bears previously genotyped in Montana or British Columbia. In contrast with the SECR estimates, the CMR estimates represent the number of bears that southwestern Alberta residents could have encountered (i.e., the population of bears that had potential to have been involved in conflict). Shifts in grizzly bear distribution resulted in large changes in our SECR density estimates between years, whereas our estimate of the number of bears using the area remained constant. We recommend increased inter-jurisdictional monitoring and management of this international grizzly bear population.},

METHOD: Twenty healthy animals, free living in a forest reserve, that were captured for clinical evaluation as part of a health survey were evaluated. Schirmer tear test-1 (STT1), conjunctival microbiota, intraocular pressure (IOP), conjunctival cytology, anatomy of the bony orbit, and ocular histology were studied. RESULTS: Mean ± SD STT1 and IOP values were 18.8 ± 4.7 mm and 11.4 ± 2.8 mmHg, respectively. IOP was significantly higher in adult (4-8 years) animals (P = 0.04). Bacterial growth was present in 100\% of the samples, with a prevalence for Staphylococcus sp. and Bacillus sp. The conjunctival cytology revealed predominance of columnar epithelial cells with mild pigmentation. The sambar deer orbit is completely encompassed by bone. The ocular histology was very similar to most mammalians. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study will be useful in the diagnosis of ocular diseases in Rusa unicolor.},

	abstract = {Quantifying temporal changes in harvested populations is critical for applied and fundamental research. Unbiased data are required to detect true changes in phenotypic distribution or population size. Because of the difficulty of collecting detailed individual data from wild populations, data from hunting records are often used. Hunting records, however, may not represent a random sample of a population. We aimed to detect and quantify potential bias in hunting records. We compared data from a long-term monitoring project with hunting records of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Sweden and investigated temporal trends (1996–2013) in the ratio of yearlings to adult females, yearling mass and adult female mass. Data from hunting records underestimated the decline in yearling and adult female mass over time, most likely owing to the legal protection of family groups from hunting, but reflected changes in the ratio of yearlings to adult females more reliably. Although hunting data can be reliable to approximate population abundance in some circumstances, hunting data can represent a biased sample of a population and should be used with caution in management and conservation decisions.},

	abstract = {Ranger stations are essential to combat poaching in protected areas and the distance from ranger stations is sometimes used as a proxy for poaching levels and law enforcement intensity. However, the influence of the spatial distribution of ranger stations on wildlife abundance and population structure has rarely been investigated. We evaluated the abundance and distribution of urial sheep Ovis vignei and Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor in the steppe of Golestan National Park in northeastern Iran. The spatial distribution of these species in regard to anthropogenic (distances to ranger stations, villages and park border) and environmental variables (distance to water resources, average slope and normalized difference vegetation index) was assessed using systematic line transect sampling (186 km) and camera trapping (1150 trap nights). The studied steppe area is divided into three management zones differing in the number of ranger stations and their position with respect to park boundaries. The results of multivariate analyses highlighted that the distance to ranger stations was negatively related to the size and density of urial clusters and the most important variable in explaining urial distribution. Moreover, the distance to park borders influenced urial cluster density. Leopard abundance was positively associated with urial density but was less affected by the other variables tested. We found urial densities in the three management zones to range from 0.15 ± se 0.09 individuals km−2 (zone with just one station outside the park) to 21.77 ± se 7.92 individuals km−2 (zone with three stations). Taking into account these results and historical data on ungulate abundance and distribution in these management zones, we conclude that law enforcement from ranger stations has shaped current patterns of ungulate distribution. These results confirm that a good coverage (both numbers and locations) of ranger stations is of central importance for the management of protected areas.},

This relationship is robust across species, but evidence is ambiguous within species. We do not know whether individual males reduce their care when paired with cheating females compared with when paired with faithful females (within-male adjustment) or, alternatively, if the males that pair with cheating females are the same males that provide less parental care in general (between-male effect). Our exceptionally extensive long-term data set of repeated observations of a wild passerine allows us to disentangle paternal care adjustment within males—within pairs and between males—while accounting for environmental variables. We found a within-male adjustment of paternal provisioning, but not incubation effort, relative to the cuckoldry in their nest. This effect was mainly driven by females differing consistently in their fidelity. There was no evidence that this within-male adjustment also took place across broods with the same female, and we found no between-male effect. Interestingly, males that gained more extrapair paternity provided less care. Data from a cross-foster experiment suggested that males did not use kin recognition to assess paternity. Our results provide insight into the role of individual variation in parental care and mating systems.},

Next we compared habitat quality metrics emerging from this analysis as well as an independent measure of prey abundance, with pack size and territory size to investigate which hypothesis was most supported by the data. 3.We show that wolf space use patterns were concentrated near deciduous, mixed deciduous/coniferous and disturbed forest stands favoured by moose (Alces alces), the predominant prey species in the diet of wolves in northern Ontario, and in proximity to linear corridors, including shorelines and road networks remaining from commercial forestry activities. 4.We then demonstrate that landscape metrics of wolf habitat quality - projected wolf use, probability of moose occupancy and proportion of preferred land cover classes - were inversely related to territory size but unrelated to pack size. 5.These results suggest that wolves in boreal ecosystems alter territory size, but not pack size, in response to local variation in habitat quality. This could be an adaptive strategy to balance tradeoffs between territorial defense costs and energetic gains due to resource acquisition. That pack size was not responsive to habitat quality suggests that variation in group size is influenced by other factors such as intra-specific competition between wolf packs.

	abstract = {When estimating population density from data collected on non-invasive detector arrays, recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models present an advance over non-spatial models by accounting for individual movement. While these models should be more robust to changes in trapping designs, they have not been well tested. Here we investigate how the spatial arrangement and size of the trapping array influence parameter estimates for SCR models. We analysed black bear data collected with 123 hair snares with an SCR model accounting for differences in detection and movement between sexes and across the trapping occasions. To see how the size of the trap array and trap dispersion influence parameter estimates, we repeated analysis for data from subsets of traps: 50\% chosen at random, 50\% in the centre of the array and 20\% in the South of the array. Additionally, we simulated and analysed data under a suite of trap designs and home range sizes. In the black bear study, we found that results were similar across trap arrays, except when only 20\% of the array was used. Black bear density was approximately 10 individuals per 100 km(2). Our simulation study showed that SCR models performed well as long as the extent of the trap array was similar to or larger than the extent of individual movement during the study period, and movement was at least half the distance between traps. SCR models performed well across a range of spatial trap setups and animal movements. Contrary to non-spatial capture-recapture models, they do not require the trapping grid to cover an area several times the average home range of the studied species. This renders SCR models more appropriate for the study of wide-ranging mammals and more flexible to design studies targeting multiple species.},

	abstract = {Humans show large differences in the preferred timing of their sleep and activity. This so-called "chronotype" is largely regulated by the circadian clock. Both genetic variations in clock genes and environmental influences contribute to the distribution of chronotypes in a given population, ranging from extreme early types to extreme late types with the majority falling between these extremes. Social (e.g., school and work) schedules interfere considerably with individual sleep preferences in the majority of the population. Late chronotypes show the largest differences in sleep timing between work and free days leading to a considerable sleep debt on work days, for which they compensate on free days. The discrepancy between work and free days, between social and biological time, can be described as 'social jetlag.' Here, we explore how sleep quality and psychological wellbeing are associated with individual chronotype and/or social jetlag. A total of 501 volunteers filled out the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) as well as additional questionnaires on: (i) sleep quality (SF-A), (ii) current psychological wellbeing (Basler Befindlichkeitsbogen), (iii) retrospective psychological wellbeing over the past week (POMS), and (iv) consumption of stimulants (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol). Associations of chronotype, wellbeing, and stimulant consumption are strongest in teenagers and young adults up to age 25 yrs. The most striking correlation exists between chronotype and smoking, which is significantly higher in late chronotypes of all ages (except for those in retirement). We show these correlations are most probably a consequence of social jetlag, i.e., the discrepancies between social and biological timing rather than a simple association to different chronotypes. Our results strongly suggest that work (and school) schedules should be adapted to chronotype whenever possible.},

	abstract = {Designing and implementing natural resource monitoring is a challenging endeavor undertaken by many agencies, NGOs, and citizen groups worldwide. Yet many monitoring programs fail to deliver useful information for a variety of administrative (staffing, documentation, and funding) or technical (sampling design and data analysis) reasons. Programs risk failure if they lack a clear motivating problem or question, explicit objectives linked to this problem or question, and a comprehensive conceptual model of the system under study. Designers must consider what “success” looks like from a resource management perspective, how desired outcomes translate to appropriate attributes to monitor, and how they will be measured. All such efforts should be filtered through the question “Why is this important?” Failing to address these considerations will produce a program that fails to deliver the desired information. We addressed these issues through creation of a “road map” for designing and implementing a monitoring program, synthesizing multiple aspects of a monitoring program into a single, overarching framework. The road map emphasizes linkages among core decisions to ensure alignment of all components, from problem framing through technical details of data collection and analysis, to program administration. Following this framework will help avoid common pitfalls, keep projects on track and budgets realistic, and aid in program evaluations. The road map has proved useful for monitoring by individuals and teams, those planning new monitoring, and those reviewing existing monitoring and for staff with a wide range of technical and scientific skills.},

	abstract = {I review the use of auxiliary variables in capture- recapture models for estimation of demographic parameters (e.g. capture probability, population size, survival probability, and recruitment, emigration and immigration numbers). I focus on what has been done in current research and what still needs to be done. Typically in the literature, covariate modelling has made capture and survival probabilities functions of covariates, but there are good reasons also to make other parameters functions of covariates as well. The types of covariates considered include environmental covariates that may vary by occasion but are constant over animals, and individual animal covariates that are usually assumed constant over time. I also discuss the diý culties of using time-dependent individual animal covariates and some possible solutions. Covariates are usually assumed to be measured without er ror, and that may not be realistic. For closed populations, one approach to modelling heterogeneity in capture probabilities uses observable individual covariates and is thus related to the primary purpose of this paper. The now standard Huggins-Alho approach conditions on the captured animals and then uses a generalized Horvitz-Thompson estimator to estimate population size. This approach has the advantage of simplicity in that one does not have to specify a distribution for the covariates, and the disadvantage is that it does not use the full likelihood to estimate population size. Alternately one could specify a distribution for the covariates and implement a full likelihood approach to inference to estimate the capture function, the covariate probability distribution, and the population size. The general Jolly- Seber open model enables one to estimate capture probability, population sizes, survival rates, and birth numbers. Much of the focus on modelling covariates in program MARK has been for survival and capture probability in the Cormack- Jolly-Seber model and its generalizations (including tag-return models). These models condition on the number of animals marked and released. A related, but distinct, topic is radio telemetry survival modelling that typically uses a modi® ed Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model for auxiliary variables. Recently there has been an emphasis on integration of recruitment in the likelihood, and research on how to implement covariate modelling for recruitment and perhaps population size is needed. The combined open and closed `robust’ design model can also bene® t from covariate modelling and some important options have already been implemented into MARK. Many models are usually ® tted to one data set. This has necessitated development of model selection criteria based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) and the alternative of averaging over reasonable models. The special problems of estimating over-dispersion when covariates are included in the model and then adjusting for over-dispersion in model selection could bene® t from further research.},

	abstract = {Most methods for modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a procedure for quantify-ing movement sequences in terms of move length and turning angle probability distributions. By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displace-ment formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Obser-vations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circum-stances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these ex-amples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes. 1969). Alternatively, much progress has also been made by describing movement with analytical models that rely on the assumption of random motion (see especially, the pioneering work of Broadbent and Kendall 1953; Skellam 1951). In this paper, we extend an earlier formula concerning discrete random walks (see appendix of Jones 1977) and develop an analytic expression for net displace-ment in a correlated random walk. The formula that we develop fills a gap somewhere between the powerful general diffusion models of Skellam (1951) and the realistic detailed simulations of Jones (1977). One of the advantages of our approach is that it produces a summary of behavior that enables compari-sons to be made between different organisms, or for the same organism in different situations. In particular, by making the assumption of correlated random movement, we derive a formula for expected net displacement in terms of easily observed distance and directionality parameters. This formula can serve as a means for exploring the consequences of varying rules of movement. We illustrate the approach by applying it to two examples of insect movement.},

In this paper, twelve approaches were compared using two species in Europe and artificial neural networks, and the modelling results were assessed using four indices: sensitivity, specificity, overall prediction success and Cohen's kappa statistic. The results show that prevalence approach, average predicted probability/suitability approach, and three sensitivity-specificity-combined approaches, including sensitivity-specificity sum maximization approach, sensitivity-specificity equality approach and the approach based on the shortest distance to the top-left corner (0,1) in ROC plot, are the good ones. The commonly used kappa maximization approach is not as good as the afore-mentioned ones, and the fixed threshold approach is the worst one. We also recommend using datasets with prevalence of 50\% to build models if possible since most optimization criteria might be satisfied or nearly satisfied at the same time, and therefore it's easier to find optimal thresholds in this situation.},

	abstract = {Site occupancy, as estimated by the probability of presence, is used for monitoring species populations. However, the detection of species at individual sites is often subject to errors. In order to accurately estimate occupancy we must simultaneously account for imperfect detectability by estimating the probability of detection. The problem with estimating occupancy arises from not knowing whether a nondetection occurred at an occupied site due to imperfect detectability (sampling zeros), or the nondetection resulting from an unoccupied site (fixed zeros). We evaluated the performance of the basic, normal approximation, studentised and percentile methods for approximating confidence limits for occupancy and detection of species. Using coverage and average interval width, we demonstrated that the studentised estimator was generally superior to the others, except when a small sample of sites are selected. Under this circumstance and when calculating limits for detection, no estimator produced reliable results. The experimental factors we considered include: (i) number of sites; (ii) number of survey occasions; (iii) probabilities of presence (occupancy) and detection; and (iv) overdispersion in the capture matrix. Similar conclusions were reached both for the simulated studies and a case study. Overall, estimation near the boundaries of the probability of occupancy and detectability was difficult},

	abstract = {Environmental impacts of wind energy facilities increasingly cause concern, a central issue being bats and birds killed by rotor blades. Two approaches have been employed to assess collision rates: carcass searches and surveys of animals prone to collisions. Carcass searches can provide an estimate for the actual number of animals being killed but they offer little information on the relation between collision rates and, for example, weather parameters due to the time of death not being precisely known. In contrast, a density index of animals exposed to collision is sufficient to analyse the parameters influencing the collision rate. However, quantification of the collision rate from animal density indices (e.g. acoustic bat activity or bird migration traffic rates) remains difficult. We combine carcass search data with animal density indices in a mixture model to investigate collision rates. In a simulation study we show that the collision rates estimated by our model were at least as precise as conventional estimates based solely on carcass search data. Furthermore, if certain conditions are met, the model can be used to predict the collision rate from density indices alone, without data from carcass searches. This can reduce the time and effort required to estimate collision rates. We applied the model to bat carcass search data obtained at 30 wind turbines in 15 wind facilities in Germany. We used acoustic bat activity and wind speed as predictors for the collision rate. The model estimates correlated well with conventional estimators. Our model can be used to predict the average collision rate. It enables an analysis of the effect of parameters such as rotor diameter or turbine type on the collision rate. The model can also be used in turbine-specific curtailment algorithms that predict the collision rate and reduce this rate with a minimal loss of energy production.},

	abstract = {Most studies describing animal movements have been developed in the framework of population dispersion or population dynamics, and have mainly focused on movements in open spaces. During their trips, however, animals are likely to encounter physical heterogeneities that guide their movements and, as a result, influence their spatial distribution. In this paper, we develop a statistical model of individual movement in a bounded space. We introduced cockroaches in a circular arena and quantified accurately the behaviors underlying their movement in a finite space. Close to the edges, we considered that the animals exhibit a linear movement mode with a constant probability per unit time to leave the edge and enter the central zone of the arena. Far from the walls cockroaches were assumed to move according to a diffusive random walk which enabled us to overcome the inherent problem of the quantification of the turning angle distribution. A numerical model implementing the behavioral rules derived from our experiments, confirms that the pattern of the spatial distribution of animals observed can be reliably accounted for by wall-following behaviors combined with a diffusive random walk. The approach developed in this study can be applied to model the movements of animals in various environment under consideration of spatial structure. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Capture-recapture methods aim to estimate the size of a closed population on the basis of multiple incomplete enumerations of individuals. In many applications, the individual probability of being recorded is heterogeneous in the population. Previous studies have suggested that it is not possible to reliably estimate the total population size when capture heterogeneity exists. Here we approach population estimation in the presence of capture heterogeneity as a latent length biased nonparametric density estimation problem on the unit interval. We show that in this setting it is generally impossible to estimate the density on the entire unit interval in finite samples, and that estimators of the population size have high and sometimes unbounded risk when the density has significant mass near zero. As an alternative, we propose estimating the population of individuals with capture probability exceeding some threshold. We provide methods for selecting an appropriate threshold, and show that this approach results in estimators with substantially lower risk than estimators of the total population size, with correspondingly smaller uncertainty, even when the parameter of interest is the total population. The alternative paradigm is demonstrated in extensive simulation studies and an application to snowshoe hare multiple recapture data.},

Simulated habitat use on different habitat preference maps was consistent with expected habitat use resulting from preference for and abundance of the habitat types. The spatial pattern of habitat use depended on the activity rather than on the movement parameters. Realistic patterns were only obtained when parameter values for activity were based upon field data, regardless of whether movement parameters were random or data-based. While activity parameters have no explicit information on habitat use, those describing the occurrence and duration of the behaviours do contain implicit spatial information. Data-based movement and/or random activity resulted in a larger range than random movement and/or data-based activity.

We used Ecuadorian frogs of the family Dendrobatidae to illustrate our methodology. For dendrobatids there are several cases for which there is significant environmental divergence for allopatric and parapatric lineages. The consistent pattern that many related taxa or nodes exist in distinct environmental space reinforces Lynch and Duellman's hypothesis that differential selection likely played an important role in species differentiation of frogs in the Andes. There is also some evidence that the Río Esmeraldas basin is a geographic barrier to species distributed in low to middle elevations on the western side of the Andes. Another useful aspect of this approach is that it can point to common environmental parameters that correlate with speciation. For dendrobatids, sister clades generally segregate along temperature/elevational and/or seasonality axes. The joint analysis of environmental and geographic data for this group of dendrobatid frogs has identified potentially important speciation mechanisms and specific sister lineages that warrant intensive study to test hypotheses generated in this investigation. Further, the method outlined in this paper will be increasingly useful as knowledge of distribution and phylogeny of tropical species increases.},

	abstract = {Documenting changes in distribution is necessary for understanding species' response to environmental changes, but data on species distributions are heterogeneous in accuracy and resolution. Combining different data sources and methodological approaches can fill gaps in knowledge about the dynamic processes driving changes in species-rich, but data-poor regions. We combined recent bird survey data from the Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps) with historical distribution records to estimate potential changes in the distribution of eight species of Amazon parrots in Venezuela. Using environmental covariates and presence-only data from museum collections and the literature, we first used maximum likelihood to fit a species distribution model (SDM) estimating a historical maximum probability of occurrence for each species. We then used recent, NeoMaps survey data to build single-season occupancy models (OM) with the same environmental covariates, as well as with time- and effort-dependent detectability, resulting in estimates of the current probability of occurrence. We finally calculated the disagreement between predictions as a matrix of probability of change in the state of occurrence. Our results suggested negative changes for the only restricted, threatened species, Amazona barbadensis, which has been independently confirmed with field studies. Two of the three remaining widespread species that were detected, Amazona amazonica, Amazona ochrocephala, also had a high probability of negative changes in northern Venezuela, but results were not conclusive for Amazona farinosa. The four remaining species were undetected in recent field surveys; three of these were most probably absent from the survey locations (Amazona autumnalis, Amazona mercenaria and Amazona festiva), while a fourth (Amazona dufresniana) requires more intensive targeted sampling to estimate its current status. Our approach is unique in taking full advantage of available, but limited data, and in detecting a high probability of change even for rare and patchily-distributed species. However, it is presently limited to species meeting the strong assumptions required for maximum-likelihood estimation with presence-only data, including very high detectability and representative sampling of its historical distribution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The defining assumption of geographic and demographic closure (i.e., no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration) for the duration of sampling is restrictive and is likely to be violated in many field situations. I evaluated several types of violations of the closure assumption and found that completely random movement in and out of a study area does not introduce bias to estimators from closed-population methods, although it decreases precision. In addition, if capture probabilities vary only with time, the closed-population Lincoln-Petersen estimator is unbiased for the size of the superpopulation when there are only births/immigration or only deaths/emigration. However, for other cases of nonrandom movement, closed-population estimators were biased when movement was Markovian (de- pendent on the presence/absence of the animal in the previous time period), when an animal was allowed one entry to and one exit from the study area, or when there was trap response or heterogeneity among animals in capture probability. In addition, the probability that an animal is present and available for capture (e.g., breeding propensity) can be estimated using Pollock’s robust design only when movement occurs at a broader temporal scale than that of sampling.},

We examine three methods to incorporate time varying, individual covariates of the survival probabilities into the analysis of data from mark-recapture-recovery experiments: deterministic imputation, a Bayesian imputation approach based on modeling the joint distribution of the covariate and the capture history, and a conditional approach considering only the events for which the associated covariate data are completely observed (the trinomial model). After describing the three methods, we compare results from their application to the analysis of the effect of body mass on the survival of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the Isle of Hirta, Scotland. Simulations based on these results are then used to make further comparisons. We conclude that both the trinomial model and Bayesian imputation method perform best in different situations. If the capture and recovery probabilities are all high, then the trinomial model produces precise, unbiased estimators that do not depend on any assumptions regarding the distribution of the covariate. In contrast, the Bayesian imputation method performs substantially better when capture and recovery probabilities are low, provided that the specified model of the covariate is a good approximation to the true data-generating mechanism.},

Subsequent biological inference and interpretation of model parameters depend on these definitions and the ability to meet model assumptions. 4. Wedemonstrate the relevance of these definitions by highlighting applications from a single biological system (an amphibian–pathogen system) and discuss situations where the use of occupancy models has been criticized.

	abstract = {Genetic sampling is increasingly used as a tool by wildlife biologists and managers to estimate abundance and density of species. Typically, DNA is used to identify individuals captured in an array of traps (e.g., baited hair snares) from which individual encounter histories are derived. Standard methods for estimating the size of a closed population can be applied to such data. However, due to the movement of individuals on and off the trapping array during sampling, the area over which individuals are exposed to trapping is unknown, and so obtaining unbiased estimates of density has proved difficult. We propose a hierarchical spatial capture-recapture model which contains explicit models for the spatial point process governing the distribution of individuals and their exposure to (via movement) and detection by traps. Detection probability is modeled as a function of each individual's distance to the trap. We applied this model to a black bear (Ursus americanus) study conducted in 2006 using a hair-snare trap array in the Adirondack region of New York, USA. We estimated the density of bears to be 0.159 bears/km2, which is lower than the estimated density (0.410 bears/km2) based on standard closed population techniques. A Bayesian analysis of the model is fully implemented in the software program WinBUGS.},

The gradients are the basis for succinctly describing and visualizing the differential habitat preferences (niches) of taxavia an ordination diagram. Linear multivariate methods for relating two set of variables, such as two-block Partial Least Squares (PLS2), canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, are less suited for this purpose because habitat preferences are often unimodal functions of habitat variables. After pointing out the key assumptions underlying CCA, the paper focuses on the interpretation of CCA ordination diagrams. Subsequently, some advanced uses, such as ranking environmental variables in importance and the statistical testing of effects are illustrated on a typical macroinvertebrate data-set. The paper closes with comparisons with correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, PLS2 and co-inertia analysis.

	abstract = {Over the past century, the endangered Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) has experienced a severe contraction in demography and geographic range because of habitat loss, poaching, and prey depletion. In its historical home in Northeast China, there appears to be a single tiger population that includes tigers in Southwest Primorye and Northeast China; however, the current demographic status of this population is uncertain. Information on the abundance, distribution and genetic diversity of this population for assessing the efficacy of conservation interventions are scarce. We used noninvasive genetic detection data from scats, capture-recapture models and an accumulation curve method to estimate the abundance of Amur tigers in Northeast China. We identified 11 individual tigers (6 females and 5 males) using 10 microsatellite loci in three nature reserves between April 2013 and May 2015. These tigers are confined primarily to a Hunchun Nature Reserve along the border with Russia, with an estimated population abundance of 9-11 tigers during the winter of 2014-2015. They showed a low level of genetic diversity. The mean number of alleles per locus was 2.60 and expected and observed heterozygosity were 0.42 and 0.49, respectively. We also documented long-distance dispersal ({\textasciitilde}270 km) of a male Amur tiger to Huangnihe Nature Reserve from the border, suggesting that the expansion of neighboring Russian populations may eventually help sustain Chinese populations. However, the small and isolated population recorded by this study demonstrate that there is an urgent need for more intensive regional management to create a tiger-permeable landscape and increased genetic connectivity with other populations.},

	abstract = {The Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) is an endangered rodent with a restricted geographic range and small population size. Establishing an efficient monitoring program of its abundance has been problematic; previous trapping designs have not worked well because the species is sparsely distributed. We compared Key Largo woodrat abundance estimates in Key Largo, Florida, USA, obtained using trapping point transects (TPT) and spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) based on statistical properties, survey effort, practicality, and cost. Both methods combine aspects of distance sampling with capture–recapture, but TPT relies on radiotracking individuals to estimate detectability and SECR relies on repeat capture information to estimate densities of home ranges. Abundance estimates using TPT in the spring of 2007 and 2008 were 333 woodrats (CV = 0.46) and 696 (CV = 0.43), respectively. Abundance estimates using SECR in the spring, summer, and winter of 2007 were 97 (CV = 0.31), 334 (CV = 0.26), and 433 (CV = 0.20) animals, respectively. Trapping point transects used approximately 960 person-hours and 1,010 trap-nights/season. Spatially explicit capture–recapture used approximately 500 person-hours and 6,468 trap-nights/season. Significant time was saved in the SECR survey by setting large numbers of traps close together, minimizing time walking between traps. Trapping point transects were practical to implement in the field, and valuable auxiliary information on Key Largo woodrat behavior was obtained via radiocollaring. In this particular study, detectability of the woodrat using TPT was very low and consequently the SECR method was more efficient. Both methods require a substantial investment in survey effort to detect any change in abundance because of large uncertainty in estimates.},

Some species lend themselves more to active searching: a polygonal plot may be searched repeatedly and the locations of detected individuals recorded, or a plot may be searched just once and multiple cues (feces or other sign) identified as belonging to particular individuals. This report presents new likelihood-based spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods for such data. The methods are shown to be at least as robust in simulations as an equivalent Bayesian analysis, and to have negligible bias and near-nominal confidence interval coverage with parameter values from a lizard data set. It is recommended on the basis of simulation that plots for SECR should be at least as large as the home range of the target species. The R package "secr" may be used to fit the models. The likelihood-based implementation extends the spatially explicit analyses available for search data to include binary data (animal detected or not detected on each occasion) or count data (multiple detections per occasion) from multiple irregular polygons, with or without dependence among polygons. It is also shown how the method may be adapted for detections along a linear transect.},

This is not addressed in conventional closed-population estimates of abundance and without the spatial component, rigorous estimates of density cannot be obtained. We propose new, flexible capture-recapture models that use the capture locations to estimate animal locations and spatially referenced capture probability. The models are likelihood-based and hence allow use of Akaike's information criterion or other likelihood-based methods of model selection. Density is an explicit parameter, and the evaluation of its dependence on spatial or temporal covariates is therefore straightforward. Additional (nonspatial) variation in capture probability may be modeled as in conventional capture-recapture. The method is tested by simulation, using a model in which capture probability depends only on location relative to traps. Point estimators are found to be unbiased and standard error estimators almost unbiased. The method is used to estimate the density of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) from mist-netting data from the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland, U.S.A. Estimates agree well with those from an existing spatially explicit method based on inverse prediction. A variety of additional spatially explicit models are fitted; these include models with temporal stratification, behavioral response, and heterogeneous animal home ranges.},

	abstract = {Animal interpatch movement and spatial distribution are known to be influenced substantially by the composition of the landscape matrix, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In previous mark?/ recapture experiments we have found that the rates of emigration and immigration for the planthopper Prokelisia crocea are greater within a matrix composed of the introduced grass smooth brome (Bromus inermis) than a mudflat matrix. Additionally, census data indicated that individuals aggregate near the edge of host-plant patches (prairie cordgrass; Spartina pectinata) bordered by mudflat, but not in patches bordered by nonhost grasses such as brome. Here, we investigate the mechanistic basis of these matrix effects by tracking the individual movements of planthoppers released at the edge of brome- and mudflat- bordered cordgrass patches, and within homogeneous habitats of each type (cordgrass, brome, and mudflat). We found that patch edges bordered by brome were three times more permeable to emigration than mudflat-bordered edges. Also, planthoppers exhibited no tendency to avoid edges by moving away (i.e. towards the patch interior). Within homogeneous habitats, comparison of the fractal dimension of movement paths revealed that movement was more linear in mudflat than in brome or cordgrass. In addition, planthoppers exhibited greater step lengths (distance moved per 10-min interval), shorter residency times (duration of pauses between movements), and greater rates of net linear displacement in mudflat than brome and cordgrass. We attribute the planthopper’s distributional patterns within patches to the lower permeability of mudflat than nonhost grass edges and the absence of edge?/ avoidance behavior. Contrary to conventional wisdom that low-resistance matrix types (e.g. those that promote high displacement rates) enhance interpatch dispersal rates, dispersal success may be higher in brome matrix because tortuous movement through this matrix increases the planthopper’s rate of encounter with cordgrass patches.},

This assumption leads to the familiar goal of regression: to minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical or Y-value distances between the points and the curve. Outliers can dominate the sum-of-the-squares calculation, and lead to misleading results. However, we know of no practical method for routinely identifying outliers when fitting curves with nonlinear regression.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We describe a new method for identifying outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression. We first fit the data using a robust form of nonlinear regression, based on the assumption that scatter follows a Lorentzian distribution. We devised a new adaptive method that gradually becomes more robust as the method proceeds. To define outliers, we adapted the false discovery rate approach to handling multiple comparisons. We then remove the outliers, and analyze the data using ordinary least-squares regression. Because the method combines robust regression and outlier removal, we call it the ROUT method. When analyzing simulated data, where all scatter is Gaussian, our method detects (falsely) one or more outlier in only about 1-3\% of experiments. When analyzing data contaminated with one or several outliers, the ROUT method performs well at outlier identification, with an average False Discovery Rate less than 1\%.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: Our method, which combines a new method of robust nonlinear regression with a new method of outlier identification, identifies outliers from nonlinear curve fits with reasonable power and few false positives.},

One of the main monitoring techniques is the howling survey, which is based on the wolves’ tendency to use vocalisations to mark territory ownership in response to howls of unknown individuals. In most cases wolf howling sessions are useful for the localisation of the pack, but they provide only an aural estimation of the chorus size. We tested and present a new bioacoustic approach to estimate chorus size by recording wolves’ replies and visualising choruses through spectrograms and spectral envelopes. To test the methodology, we compared: a) the values detected by visual inspections with the true chorus size to test for accuracy; b) the bioacoustic estimations of a sample of free-ranging wolves’ replies developed by different operators to test for precision of the method; c) the aural field estimation of chorus size of a sample of free-ranging wolves’ replies with the sonogram analysis of the same recordings to test for difference between methods.},

	abstract = {Animal searches cover a full range of possibilities from highly deterministic to apparently completely random behaviors. However, even those stochastic components of animal movement can be adaptive, since not all random distributions lead to similar success in finding targets. Here we address the general problem of optimizing encounter rates in non-deterministic, non-oriented searches, both in homogeneous and patchy target landscapes. Specifically, we investigate how two different features related to turning angle distributions influence encounter success: (i) the shape (relative kurtosis) of the angular distribution and (ii) the correlations between successive relative orientations (directional memory). Such influence is analyzed in correlated random walk models using a proper choice of representative turning angle distributions of the recently proposed Jones and Pewsey class. We consider the cases of distributions with nearly the same shape but considerably distinct correlation lengths, and distributions with same correlation but with contrasting relative kurtosis. In homogeneous landscapes, we find that the correlation length has a large influence in the search efficiency. Moreover, similar search efficiencies can be reached by means of distinctly shaped turning angle distributions, provided that the resulting correlation length is the same. In contrast, in patchy landscapes the particular shape of the distribution also becomes relevant for the search efficiency, specially at high target densities. Excessively sharp distributions generate very inefficient searches in landscapes where local target density fluctuations are large. These results are of evolutionary interest. On the one hand, it is shown that equally successful directional memory can arise from contrasting turning behaviors, therefore increasing the likelihood of robust adaptive stochastic behavior. On the other hand, when target landscape is patchy, adequate tumbling may help to explore better local scale heterogeneities, being some details of the shape of the distribution also potentially adaptive. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in individual responses to statements about emotions, behavioural intentions, beliefs, and attitudes toward wolves and wolf management between 2009 and 2013 were assessed using a nine-item scaled variable called ‘tolerance’. Although the majority (66\%) of wolf range respondents approved of the decision to hold the hunt, the results indicate a negative trend in attitudes toward wolves among male respondents and hunters living in wolf range, both before and after the state's first legal hunt, suggesting that hunting was not associated with an increase in tolerance for the species after one year.

In this study we compared the genetic structure of wolf populations in Italy and Croatia, aiming to identify the sources of the ongoing recolonization of the Eastern Alps.

Wolves in Croatia were more variable at STR loci (NA=7.4, HO=0.66, HE=0.72; n=152) than wolves in Italy (NA=5.3, HO=0.57, HE=0.58; n=282). We found four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA CR1) and 11 Y-STR haplotypes in Croatian wolves, but only one mtDNA CR1 and three Y-STR haplotypes in Italy. Wolves in Croatia were subdivided into three genetically distinct subpopulations (in Dalmatia, Gorski kotar and Lika regions), while Italian wolves were not sub-structured. Assignment testing shows that the eastern and central Alps are recolonized by wolves dispersing from both the Italian and Dinaric populations. The recolonization of the Alps will predictably continue in the future and the new population will be genetically admixed and very variable with greater opportunities for local adaptations and survival. © 2013 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

	abstract = {Dispersal in animal populations is intimately linked with accession to reproduction, i.e. recruitment, and population regulation. Dispersal processes are thus a key component of population dynamics to the same extent as reproduction or mortality processes. Despite the growing interest in spatial aspects of population dynamics, the methodology for estimating dispersal, in particular in relation with recruitment, is limited. In many animal populations, in particular vertebrates, the impossibility of following individuals over space and time in an exhaustive way leads to the need to frame the estimation of dispersal in the context of capture-recapture methodology. We present here a class of age-dependent multistate capture-recapture models for the simultaneous estimation of natal dispersal, breeding dispersal, and age-dependent recruitment. These models are suitable for populations in which individuals are marked at birth and then recaptured over several sites. Under simple constraints, they can be used in populations where non-breeders are not observed, as is often the case with colonial waterbirds monitored on their breeding grounds. Biological questions can be addressed by comparing models differing in structure, according to the generalized linear model philosophy broadly used in capture-recapture methodology. We illustrate the potential of this approach by an analysis of recruitment and dispersal in the roseate tern Sterna dougallii.},

	abstract = {West African lions are critically endangered throughout their range. Recent monitoring efforts focused on determining where remaining populations persist and obtaining preliminary population estimates to assess status across the region. However, current monitoring methods do not result in estimates that can be easily compared across sites or over time. Thus, there is a need to develop methods that allow for unbiased and precise comparable population parameter estimates for baseline and long-term monitoring. Spatial mark-resight models offer the ability to estimate lion density for a site over a standardized unit of area making estimates comparable. In addition, Bayesian inference is not constrained by asymptotic assumptions and allows for unbiased and precise estimates even with small sample sizes and low detection rates. We demonstrate the utility of Bayesian inference of a spatial mark-resight model for West African lion populations using a single-season camera trap survey at a study site in Niokolo-Koba National Park, Senegal. We estimated a site specific density of 3.02 lions/100 km2 (1.72–5.57/100 km2) based on trap-specific relocations of individuals with unique identifying natural marks, and counts of unmarked individuals at each trap. We conclude with a discussion of limitations of the current study and possible improvements on this method. We suggest immediate action including site specific monitoring within protected areas to conserve lions in this most northern part of their range. This monitoring approach can provide useful estimates over large areas providing an easily implemented and repeatable methodology for local and regional monitoring of critically endangered lion populations.},

This is achieved by a combination of DNA extraction from bone powder using a buffer consisting solely of EDTA and proteinase K, and purification of the DNA by binding to silica in the presence of high concentrations of guanidinium thiocyanate. All steps are performed at room temperature (20–23 °C), thereby reducing further degradation of the already damaged and fragile ancient DNA and providing an optimal trade-off between DNA release and degradation. Furthermore, the purification step removes most of the various types of PCR inhibitors present in ancient bone samples, thereby optimizing the amount of ancient DNA available for subsequent enzymatic manipulation, such as PCR amplification. The protocol presented here allows DNA extraction from ancient bone and teeth with a minimum of working steps and equipment and yields DNA extracts within 2 working days.},

We emphasize the importance of refining DNA extraction methods to maximize reliability and efficiency of genotyping for such DNA sources. We present a simple and general method to quantitatively compare genotyping reliability of various DNA extraction techniques and sample materials used. For bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) fecal samples we compare different fecal pellet materials, different amounts of fecal pellet material, and the effects of eliminating two DNA extraction steps for four microsatellite loci and four samples heterozygous at each locus. We evaluated 192 PCR outcomes for each treatment using indices of PCR success and peak height (signal strength) developed from analysis output of sequencer chromatograms. Outermost pellet material produced PCR results almost equivalent to DNA extracted from blood. Where any inner pellet material was used for DNA extraction, PCR results were poorer and inconsistent among samples. PCR success was not sensitive to amount of pellet material used until it was decreased to 15 mg from 60 mg. Our PCR index provides considerably more information relative to potential genotyping errors than simply comparing genotypes derived from paired fecal and blood or tissue samples. Our DNA extraction method probably has wide applicability to herbivores that produce pelleted feces where samples dry rapidly after deposition.},

Here we investigate the potential of using genetic profiles obtained from faecal DNA as a basis for population size estimation. After trialling several methods we obtained a high amplification success rate (89\%) by storing faeces in 70\% ethanol and using the guanidine thiocyanate/silica method for extraction. Using 70\% ethanol as a storage agent had the advantage of it being an antiseptic. In order to obtain reliable genotypes with fewer amplification reactions than the standard multiple-tubes approach, we devised a comparative approach in which genetic profiles were compared and replication directed at similar, but not identical, genotypes. This modified method achieved a reduction in polymerase chain reactions comparable with the maximum-likelihood model when just using reliability criteria, and was slightly better when using reliability criteria with the additional proviso that alleles must be observed twice to be considered reliable. Our comparative approach would be best suited for studies that include multiple faeces from each individual. We utilized our approach in a well-studied population of badgers from which individuals had been sampled and reliable genotypes obtained. In a study of 53 faeces sampled from three social groups over 10 days, we found that direct enumeration could not be used to estimate population size, but that the application of mark-recapture models has the potential to provide more accurate results.},

For each individual 36 PCRs were performed using DNA extractions from up to four faecal samples. We found a very large inter-individual variation in positive PCRs (P+) (36/36 for one individual and 0/36 for another). As many as 30\% of the cases led to erroneous genotypes when only one P+ was obtained. It is preferable to use at least 4 P+ per extract to reduce this proportion to less than 1\%. With 3 P+ results, erroneous genotypes were still observed in 26\% of the cases together. These results indicate that it is necessary to do a minimum of 4 PCRs per extract. In order to have a chance to observe 4 P+, three extracts should be ideally analysed for each sample. We also recommend that when possible two or more samples should be collected in the field to increase the chance of having extracts containing DNA and to provide independent replicates. While we recognise the difficulty of working with faecal samples, we advocate the use of faecal material for genetic studies of certain wild animal populations where the advantages of avoiding disturbance, stress and injury are deemed of critical importance.},

DNA was isolated and a portion of the cytochrome b gene of the mitochondrial genome amplified and sequenced from 20 of 34 scats. Species were diagnosed by comparing the resulting sequences to reference sequences generated from the blood of puma (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalus) and crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous). Scat size has previously been used to identify predators, but DNA data show that puma and jaguar scats overlap in size, as do those of puma, ocelot and fox. Prey-content analysis suggests minimal prey partitioning between pumas and jaguars. In field testing this technique for large carnivores, two potential limitations emerged: locating intact faecal samples and recovering DNA sequences from samples obtained in the wet season. Nonetheless, this study illustrates the tremendous potential of DNA faecal studies. The presence of domestic dog (Canis familiaris) in one puma scat and of wild pig (Sus scrofa), set as bait, in one jaguar sample exemplifies the forensic possibilities of this noninvasive analysis. In addition to defining the dietary habits of similar size sympatric mammals, DNA identifications from faeces allow wildlife managers to detect the presence of endangered taxa and manage prey for their conservation.},

Here we demonstrate the reliability of genotyping from elephant dung using these protocols by comparing results from dung-extracted DNA to results from blood-extracted DNA. The level of error from dung extractions was only slightly higher than from blood extractions, and conducting two extractions from each sample and a single amplification from each extraction was sufficient to eliminate error. Di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide loci were equally reliable, and low DNA quantity and quality and PCR inhibitors were not a major problem in genotyping from dung.

The resulting restriction profiles discriminated among all five canid species and correctly identified 10 'unknown' fox scats to species in blind tests. We have applied our technique to identify canids species for an environmental management study and a conservation study. We envision that our protocol, and similar ones developed for other endangered species will be greatly used for conservation management in the future.},

	abstract = {A new protocol for extraction of DNA from faeces is presented. The protocol involves gentle washing of the surface of the faeces followed by a very simple DNA extraction utilizing the wash supernatant as the source of DNA. Unlike most other protocols, it does not involve the use of proteinase K and/or organic extraction, but is instead based on adsorption of the DNA to magnetic beads. The protocol was tested by microsatellite genotyping across six loci for sheep and reindeer faeces. Comparison with DNA extracted from blood demonstrated that the protocol was very reliable, even when used on material stored for a long time. The protocol was compared with another simple, solid-phase DNA-binding protocol, with the result that the bead-based protocol gave a slightly better amplification success and a lower frequency of allelic drop-outs. Furthermore, our experiments showed that the surface wash prior to DNA extraction is a crucial step, not only for our protocol, but for other solid-phase protocols as well.},

White grub populations may be controlled by natural enemies, but the predator guild of the European species is barely known. Trophic interactions within soil food webs are difficult to study with conventional methods. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach was developed to investigate, for the first time, a soil insect predator-prey system. Can, however, highly sensitive detection methods identify carrion prey in predators, as has been shown for fresh prey? Fresh Melolontha melolontha (L.) larvae and 1- to 9-day-old carcasses were presented to Poecilus versicolor Sturm larvae. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I fragments of the prey, 175, 327 and 387 bp long, were detectable in 50\% of the predators 32 h after feeding. Detectability decreased to 18\% when a 585 bp sequence was amplified. Meal size and digestion capacity of individual predators had no influence on prey detection. Although prey consumption was negatively correlated with cadaver age, carrion prey could be detected by PCR as efficiently as fresh prey irrespective of carrion age. This is the first proof that PCR-based techniques are highly efficient and sensitive, both in fresh and carrion prey detection. Thus, if active predation has to be distinguished from scavenging, then additional approaches are needed to interpret the picture of prey choice derived by highly sensitive detection methods.},

DNA samples were collected noninvasively from shed hair and faeces and genotyped using 13-16 microsatellite loci characterized in humans. All 14 offspring could be assigned to fathers within the community. While there is a positive relationship between male rank and reproductive success, we demonstrate that a range of male mating strategies (possessiveness, opportunistic mating and consortships) can lead to paternity across all male ranks. Several adult females were at risk of breeding with close male relatives. Most successfully avoided close inbreeding but in one case a high-ranking male in the community mated with his mother and produced an offspring. In contrast to recent data on chimpanzees (P. t. verus) from the Taï forest, Côte d'Ivoire, no evidence of extra-group paternity was observed in our study. Reanalysis of Taï data using a likelihood approach casts doubt on the occurrence of extra-group paternity in that community as well.},

	abstract = {SignificanceBirds are remarkably intelligent, although their brains are small. Corvids and some parrots are capable of cognitive feats comparable to those of great apes. How do birds achieve impressive cognitive prowess with walnut-sized brains? We investigated the cellular composition of the brains of 28 avian species, uncovering a straightforward solution to the puzzle: brains of songbirds and parrots contain very large numbers of neurons, at neuronal densities considerably exceeding those found in mammals. Because these "extra" neurons are predominantly located in the forebrain, large parrots and corvids have the same or greater forebrain neuron counts as monkeys with much larger brains. Avian brains thus have the potential to provide much higher "cognitive power" per unit mass than do mammalian brains. Some birds achieve primate-like levels of cognition, even though their brains tend to be much smaller in absolute size. This poses a fundamental problem in comparative and computational neuroscience, because small brains are expected to have a lower information-processing capacity. Using the isotropic fractionator to determine numbers of neurons in specific brain regions, here we show that the brains of parrots and songbirds contain on average twice as many neurons as primate brains of the same mass, indicating that avian brains have higher neuron packing densities than mammalian brains. Additionally, corvids and parrots have much higher proportions of brain neurons located in the pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals and birds. Thus, large-brained parrots and corvids have forebrain neuron counts equal to or greater than primates with much larger brains. We suggest that the large numbers of neurons concentrated in high densities in the telencephalon substantially contribute to the neural basis of avian intelligence.},

	abstract = {The recent development of fecal-genetic capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods has increased the feasibility of estimating abundance of forest-dwelling ungulates that are difficult to survey using visual methods. Unless genetic markers differentiating sex are incorporated into such studies, however, genetic CMR approaches risk missing sex-specific differences in population trends. We developed a single-reaction genetic assay for sex and individual identification, including 10 microsatellites and an SRY marker, and applied it in the context of a post-fawning CMR study of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in forested habitat of coastal California during 2011 and 2012. We measured sex-specific abundance and sex ratios in high-quality summer habitats encompassing 4 distinct fawning areas. We detected a significant interaction between sex and year, indicating different trends in the abundance of males and females. We also detected a significant decline in abundance of females between years (P = 0.045), which agreed with independent telemetry-based estimates, and significant differences in female abundance among fawning areas (P = 0.020) but no significant differences in the abundance of males for either variable (F1-3,20 {\textless} 0.710, P {\textgreater} 0.410). When sex was not considered in the analysis, we found no significant differences in abundance between the 2 years, suggesting that differing trends between the 2 sexes obscured the female-specific patterns. We estimated average local (i.e., on the high-quality summer ranges) density (D{\textasciicircum}) for females at 41.0 (± 5.9) deer/km2 in 2011 and 29.1 (± 6.8) deer/km2 in 2012, and local density of males at 15.7 (± 3.0) deer/km2 across the 2 study years. Accordingly, sex ratios differed between years (95\% CI = 3.0-4.2 F:M ratio in 2011, 2.0-2.3 F:M ratio in 2012). Incorporating sex and individual markers into a single assay provided a cost-effective means of applying CMR estimation based on fecal DNA to a high-density ungulate population in a forested ecosystem and emphasized the importance of explicitly modeling sex in abundance estimation.},

	abstract = {Ungulate populations are important natural resources, associated with both costs and benefits. Conflicts have arisen between stakeholders who benefit from high ungulate numbers and those faced with the costs. Supplementary or diversionary feeding may potentially mitigate conflicts while maintaining harvest yields but can have conservation implications. We quantified the empirical evidence for whether the intended effects, and hence management goals, of feeding are met. We also examined whether any potential unintended consequences of feeding occur and under what conditions. We found clear evidence that supplementary feeding enhanced reproduction and population growth under certain conditions. By contrast, we found limited evidence of the effectiveness of diversionary feeding to protect crops, forestry, and natural habitats, with positive effects often undermined by increases in ungulate density. However, the use of diversionary feeding to reduce traffic collisions seems promising but requires further investigation. The unintended effects of feeding are typically complex, involving changes to demography, behavior, and vegetation with consequent cascading effects on other trophic levels, as well as exacerbated risks of disease transmission. Increased ungulate density is the primary driver behind these unintended effects, the consequences of which tend to increase with longevity of feeding and affect a range of stakeholders. We urge managers to take seriously the risks as well as the economic and ethical issues before deciding to feed ungulates. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

In the process of the reconstruction, we estimated annual mortality (caused by natural factors and culling) and birth rates by referring to the annual change in an index of population abundance and the recovery of tagged individuals. The estimated total population size decreased greatly from 303.2 to 70.8 between 1996 and 2000 in the study area (136.5 km2); the first mange-infected individual was found in 1997. The natural mortality estimate (0.613) in 1998 was high, and it was also high in 1997 and 1999 (0.504 and 0.507, respectively), whereas mortality caused by culling did not show any particular change in these years. The birth rate (number of cubs per adult) was high in 1998 and 1999 despite the mange prevalence. Although the infection rate (number of infected individuals per inspected fox) decreased after the peak in 1999, foxes were found infected with mange in every study year between 1997 and 2013, except for 2002. Natural mortality was higher during the mange period (1997–2008) than during the pre-mange period (1987–1996), whereas we did not detect a significant difference in birth rates between the periods. A generalized linear model analysis showed significant effects of adult density and birth rate on natural mortality together with the effects of mange. We interpreted higher natural mortality in years with higher birth rates as simply a result of the population in those years including more cubs with higher mortality. The positive effect of adult density during the pre-mange period on natural mortality can be explained by competition for territory, whereas high adult density may also have contributed to the spread of mange for the mange period, causing higher mortality. This study shows that the use of cohort analysis can be extended to estimating demographic parameters by referring to external data.},

Our objective was to develop a mark–recapture technique that used DNA from fecal pellets to overcome constraints associated with estimating abundance of ungulates in landscapes where direct observation is difficult. We tested our technique on Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) in the temperate coastal rainforest of Southeast Alaska. During 2006–2008, we sampled fecal pellets of deer along trail transects in 3 intensively logged watersheds on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. We extracted DNA from the surface of fecal pellets and used microsatellite markers to identify individual deer. With genotypes of individual deer, we estimated abundance of deer with moderate precision (±20\%) using mark–recapture models. Combining all study sites, we identified a 30\% (SE = 5.1\%) decline in abundance during our 3-year study, which we attributed to 3 consecutive severe winters. We determined that deer densities in managed land logged {\textgreater}30 years ago (7 deer/km2, SE = 1.3) supported fewer deer compared to both managed land logged {\textless}30 years ago (10 deer/km2, SE = 1.5) and unmanaged land (12 deer/km2, SE = 1.4). Our study provides the first estimates of abundance (based on individually identified deer) for Sitka black-tailed deer and the first estimates of abundance of an unenclosed ungulate population using DNA from fecal pellets.

	abstract = {Use of non-invasive sources of DNA, such as hair or scat, to obtain a genetic mark for population estimates is becoming commonplace. Unfortunately, with such marks, potentials for genotyping errors and for the shadow effect have resulted in use of many loci and amplification of each specimen many times at each locus, drastically increasing time and cost of obtaining a population estimate. We proposed a method, the Genotyping Uncertainty Added Variance Adjustment (GUAVA), which statistically adjusts for genotyping errors and the shadow effect, thereby allowing use of fewer loci and one amplification of each specimen per locus. Using allele frequencies and estimates of genotyping error rates, we determined, for each pair of specimens, the probability that the pair was obtained from the same individual, whether or not their observed genotypes match. Using these probabilities, we reconstructed possible capture history matrices and used this distribution to obtain a population estimate. With simulated data, we consistently found our estimates had lower bias and smaller variance than estimates based on single amplifications in which genotyping error was ignored and that were comparable to estimates based on data free of genotyping errors. We also demonstrated the method on a fecal DNA data set from a population of red wolves (Canis rufus). The GUAVA estimate based on only one amplification genotypes compares favorably to the estimate based on consensus genotypes. A program to conduct the analysis is available from the first author for UNIX or Windows platforms. Application of GUAVA may allow for increased accuracy in population estimates at reduced cost.},

	abstract = {Genetic profiling using fecal samples collected noninvasively in the wild can provide managers with an alternative to live- trapping. However, before embarking on a large-scale survey, feasibility of this methodology should be assessed for the focal species. Costs associated with fecal genotyping can be high because of the need for multiple amplifications to prevent and detect errors. Assessing the relative amount of target DNA before genotyping means samples can be eliminated where error rates will be high or amplification success will be low, thereby reducing costs. We collected fecal samples from an endangered population of swift fox (Vulpes velox) and employed target-DNA quantification and a screening protocol to assess sample quality before genetic profiling. Quantification was critical in identifying samples of low quality (68\%, ,0.2 ng/mL). Comparison of the amplification, from a subset of loci in 25 samples that did not meet the screening criteria, confirmed the effectiveness of this method. The protocol, however, used a considerable amount of DNA, and an assessment of the locus and sample variability allowed us to refine it for future population surveys. Although we did not use .50\% of the samples we collected, the remaining samples provided 36 unique genotypes, which corresponded to approximately 70\% of animals estimated to be present in the study area. Although obtaining fecal DNA from small carnivores is challenging, our protocol, including the quantification and qualification of DNA, the selection of markers, and the use of postgenotyping analyses, such as DROPOUT, CAPWIRE, and geographic information, provides a more cost-effective way to produce reliable results. The method we have developed is an informative approach that wildlife managers can use to conduct population surveys where the collection of feces is possible without the need for live-trapping.},

Focusing on bobcat (Lynx rufus), we compared the effectiveness of noninvasive hair and scat genetic sampling in terms of field sample collection, species identification, and individual identification. We describe a novel hair-snare design and sampling protocol that successfully sampled 4 sympatric carnivore species, bobcat, mountain lion (Felis concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), in 3 habitat blocks in coastal southern California, USA. Scat surveys were also successful at sampling bobcats and other carnivores in the area. Hair and scat sampling methods had similar species identification success (81\% and 87\%, respectively) using mitochondrial DNA amplification and restriction enzyme digestion patterns. Therefore, for studies focused on the distribution and activity of a suite of carnivore species, we recommend a combination of noninvasive methodologies, for example, targeting hair and scat surveys toward species and sites where they are most effective. Because of a higher success rate for scat (85\%) than for hair samples (10\%) when using 4 microsatellite loci and a multiple-tubes approach to verify individual genotypes, we suggest scat sampling is a better choice for studies that require individual identification of bobcat},

Based on species confirmations Or PID values, we detected bears at 57.1\% (96) of sites, fishers at 61.3\% (103) of sites, and bobcats at 12.5\% (21) of sites. We estimated that the mean probability of detecting the target species (when present) during a single visit to a site was 0.86 for black bears, 0.95 for fishers, and 0.40 for bobcats. The probability of detecting black bears was largely unaffected by site- or visit-specific covariates, but the probability of detecting fishers varied by detection team. We found little or no effect of topographic ruggedness, vegetation density, or local weather (e.g., temp, humidity) on detection probability for fishers or black bears (data were insufficient for bobcat analyses).

For the success of such studies it is essential to obtain the highest possible PCR amplification success rate. These rates are still relatively low in most carnivorous species, especially in the otter (Lutra lutra). We therefore optimised the entire microsatellite genotyping process by combining our findings with results from previous studies to gain a high rate of reliable genotypes. We investigated the influence of otter faecal quality in relation to the quantity of slimy secretions and three levels of storage periods at -20 degrees C on amplification success. Further, we tested the cost-effective and time-saving Chelex extraction method against the profitable QIAamp((R)) DNA Stool Kit (Qiagen), and compared three PCR methods - a standard single-step PCR protocol, a single-locus two-step PCR procedure and a multiplex two-step PCR procedure - regarding success rate and genotyping errors. The highest amplification success rate (median: 94\%; mean: 78\%) was achieved using faecal samples consisting only of jelly extracted with the QIAamp((R)) DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) immediately after collection and amplified following the time and cost efficient multiplex two-step PCR protocol. The two-step procedure, also referred to as pre-amplification approach, turned out to be the main improvement as it increases amplification success about 11\% and reduces genotyping errors about 53\%, most notably allelic dropouts.},

Estimating populations for such species is the main objective for designing conservation measures and for evaluating those that are already in place. Due to the tiger's cryptic and secretive behaviour, it is not possible to enumerate and monitor its populations through direct observations; instead indirect methods have always been used for studying tigers in the wild. DNA methods based on non-invasive sampling have not been attempted so far for tiger population studies in India. We describe here a pilot study using DNA extracted from faecal samples of tigers for the purpose of population estimation. RESULTS: In this study, PCR primers were developed based on tiger-specific variations in the mitochondrial cytochrome b for reliably identifying tiger faecal samples from those of sympatric carnivores. Microsatellite markers were developed for the identification of individual tigers with a sibling Probability of Identity of 0.005 that can distinguish even closely related individuals with 99.9\% certainty. The effectiveness of using field-collected tiger faecal samples for DNA analysis was evaluated by sampling, identification and subsequently genotyping samples from two protected areas in southern India. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using tiger faecal matter as a potential source of DNA for population estimation of tigers in protected areas in India in addition to the methods currently in use.},

The method has become an important and widely used tool to research and manage wildlife populations.However, researchers have to struggle with low amplification success rates and genotyping errors, which substantially bias subsequent analysis. To receive reliable results and to minimize the time and costs required for non-invasive microsatellite genotyping, one must carefully choose a species-specific sampling design, methods that maximize the amount of template DNA, and methods that could overcome genotyping errors, especially when using low-quality samples. This article reviews the literature and the pros and cons of the main methods used along the process described above. The review is strengthened by a case study on Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) using feces; we tested severalmethods for their appropriateness to accommodate for genotyping errors. Based on this method testing, we demonstrated that high genotyping error rates are the key problem in this process leading to a severely flawed dataset if no consensus genotype is formed. However, even if generating consensus genotypes minimizes errors dramatically, we show that it may not achieve a definite eradication of all errors, which results in overestimated population sizes if conventional estimators are used. In conjunction with these findings, we offer a step-by-step protocol for non-invasive genetic CMR studies to achieve a reliable estimate of population sizes in the presence of high genotyping error rates.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The decline in river otter ( Lontra canadensis) populations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries throughout North America has led to protective status and strict harvest regulations. Despite sustained interest in protecting river otters, relatively few contemporary studies have evaluated the current status of populations, especially in California. An effective way to estimate river otter population sizes and facilitate monitoring is with noninvasive genetic methods. Our objective was to establish baseline demographic information for an understudied river otter population in northern California by estimating river otter abundance using noninvasive genetic sampling, supplemented with data obtained from an observation-based citizen science project focusing on river otters. We extracted DNA from scat and genotyped samples at 6 microsatellite loci. We used Program MARK to build mark-recapture models to estimate river otter abundance and pooled visual observations from a citizen science project maintained in Humboldt County, California to supplement population estimates with information regarding pups and group size. Between 41 and 44 river otters were in the study area based on noninvasive genetic samples, and group sizes ranged 1-7 or 2-12 based on observational and genetic data, respectively. The Humboldt Bay region had a high density of river otters (0.93 otters/km) as compared to other coastal systems; resource attributes of Humboldt Bay could contribute to this difference. Results reported herein demonstrate methods appropriate for establishing baseline river otter demographics. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

	abstract = {Across much of North America, river otter (Lontra canadensis)   populations were extirpated or greatly reduced by the early 20th   century. More recently, reintroductions have resulted in restored   populations and the recommencement of managed trapping. Perhaps the best   example of these river otter reintroductions occurred in Missouri,   regarded as one of the most successful carnivore recovery programs in   history. However, abundance estimates for river otter populations are   difficult to obtain and often contentious when used to underpin   management activities. We assessed the value of latrine site monitoring   as a mechanism for quantifying river otter abundance. Analyses of fecal   DNA to identify individual animals may result in an improved population   estimate and have been used for a variety of mammal species. We   optimized laboratory protocols, redesigned existing microsatellite   primers, and calculated genotyping error rates to enhance genotyping   success for a large quantity of river otter scat samples. We also   developed a method for molecular sexing. We then extracted DNA from   1,421 scat samples and anal sac secretions (anal jelly) collected during   latrine site counts along 22-34-km stretches representing 8-77\% of 8   rivers in southern Missouri in 2009. Error rates were low for the   redesigned microsatellites. We obtained genotypes at 7-10 microsatellite   loci for 24\% of samples, observing highest success for anal jelly   samples (71\%) and lowest for fresh samples (collected within 1 day of   defecation). We identified 63 otters (41 M, 22 F) in the 8 rivers,   ranging from 2 to 14 otters per river. Analyses using program CAPWIRE   resulted in population estimates similar to the minimum genotyping   estimate. Density estimates averaged 0.24 otters/km. We used linear   regression to develop and contrast models predicting population size   based on latrine site and scat count indices, which are easily collected   in the field. Population size was best predicted by a combination of   scats per latrine and latrines per kilometer. Our results provide   methodological approaches to guide wildlife managers seeking to initiate   similar river otter fecal genotyping studies, as well as to estimate and   monitor river otter population sizes.

	abstract = {Sampling of feces for genetic studies of wild populations can be problematic because of the low quality and quantity of template DNA obtained. We used cotton swabs in the field to isolate the mucous layer on the surface of fresh wolf (Canis lupus, C. lycaon, and their hybrids) scats followed by immediate preservation, and compared microsatellite genotyping of DNA from these fresh field swabs (FS) to that of previously frozen laboratory swabs (LS). In single polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) of 2 multiplexes, amplification at 8 loci was higher in the FS samples (FS = 50\%, LS = 15\%; P = 0.02) because proportion, quantity, and quality of large fragment wolf nuclear DNA from these samples was greater (2.5-25\%, 6.25-62.5 ng/swab, 35\% amplified at 1,000 base pairs [bp]) than from the LS samples (1.9\%-10\%, 4.7-25 ng/swab, 10\% amplified at 1,000 bp). Paired blood and fresh field-swabbed samples had identical genotypes. In 84 multiplex PCRs we found no evidence of allelic dropout associated with low template quality or quantity. We conclude that field swabbing of fresh wolf scat facilitates field storage and reduces the need for multiple amplifications at single microsatellite loci, thereby reducing the genotyping costs for wildlife projects that use noninvasive samples.

Here, we review recent advances in noninvasive genetics and how they allow us to address important research and management questions thanks to improved techniques for DNA extraction, preservation, amplification and data analysis. We show that many advances come from the fields of forensics, human health and domestic animal health science, and suggest that molecular ecologists explore literature from these fields. Finally, we discuss how the combination of advances in each step of a noninvasive genetics study, along with fruitful areas for future research, will continually increase the power and role of noninvasive genetics in molecular ecology and conservation genetics.},

Noninvasive genetic sampling (NGS) is an alternative method that can provide data to answer management questions and complement already-existing methods. In a 2-year study, we tested this approach for Idaho gray wolves in areas of known high and low wolf density. To focus sampling efforts across a large study area and increase our chances of detecting reproductive packs, we visited 964 areas with landscape characteristics similar to known wolf rendezvous sites. We collected scat or hair samples from 20\% of sites and identified 122 wolves, using 8-9 microsatellite loci. We used the minimum count of wolves to accurately detect known differences in wolf density. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian single-session population estimators performed similarly and accurately estimated the population size, compared with a radiotelemetry population estimate, in both years, and an average of 1.7 captures per individual were necessary for achieving accurate population estimates. Subsampling scenarios revealed that both scat and hair samples were important for achieving accurate population estimates, but visiting 75\% and 50\% of the sites still gave reasonable estimates and reduced costs. Our research provides managers with an efficient and accurate method for monitoring high-density and low-density wolf populations in remote areas.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive survey methods based on analyzing DNA extracted from feces can be useful for carnivores that are difficult to study by other methods. Changes in fecal deposition patterns associated with reproduction in kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis) might affect results of such surveys. We used a trained dog to collect fresh scats on 2-km transects in the home ranges of 11 radiocollared female kit foxes in January, February, and March 2008 and determined sex of the individual that deposited the scats by amplifying the zinc finger protein gene. Female foxes give birth in mid-February to mid-March. We found a similar number of scats each month. In January, the sex ratio of the scats was not different from the expected 1:1. However, in February there were almost 2 male scats for every female scat and in March there were \&gt;8 male scats for every female scat. Comparing March to January, there were more male scats on all 11 transects and fewer female scats on 10 of 11 transects. Around the time pups are born, both sexes appear to show changes in fecal deposition patterns that make it easier to find male scats and harder to find female scats. Effects of these changes on survey results will vary depending on the purpose and design of the survey. Surveys to determine distribution and relative abundance would probably not be negatively affected by these changes. However, if surveys to estimate abundance are conducted during the reproductive season, they could result in an underestimate of population size unless the increased heterogeneity in scat detectability is taken into account.},

Previous studies reporting error rates have focused on estimating the effects of both randomly distributed and locus-specific errors. Sample-specific errors, however, can also significantly affect results in population studies despite a large sample size. From two studies including six microsatellite markers genotyped from 272 sperm whale DNA samples, and 33 microsatellites genotyped from 213 bowhead whales, we investigated the effects of sample- and locus-specific errors on calculations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results of a jackknife analysis in these two studies identified seven individuals that were highly influential on estimates of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for six different markers. In each case, the influential individual was homozygous for a rare allele. Our results demonstrate that Hardy-Weinberg P values are very sensitive to homozygosity in rare alleles for single individuals, and that {\textgreater} 50\% of these cases involved genotype errors likely due to low sample quality. This raises the possibility that even small, normal levels of laboratory errors can result in an overestimate of the degree to which markers are out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and hence overestimate population structure. To avoid such bias, we recommend routine identification of influential individuals and multiple replications of those samples.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) promises to ease non-invasive quantification of fish biomass or abundance, but its integration within conservation and fisheries management is currently limited by a lack of understanding of the influence of eDNA collection method and environmental conditions on eDNA concentrations in water samples. Water temperature is known to influence the metabolism of fish and consequently could strongly affect eDNA release rate. As water temperature varies in temperate regions (both seasonally and geographically), the unknown effect of water temperature on eDNA concentrations poses practical limitations on quantifying fish populations using eDNA from water samples. This study aims to clarify how water temperature and the eDNA capture method alter the relationships between eDNA concentration and fish abundance/biomass. Water samples (1 L) were collected from 30 aquaria including triplicate of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 Brook Charr specimens at two different temperatures. Water samples were filtered with five different types of filters. The eDNA concentration obtained by quantitative PCR (qPCR) varied significantly with fish abundance and biomass and type of filters (Mixed-design ANOVA, P {\textless} 0.001). Results also show that fish released more eDNA in warm water than cold water and that eDNA concentration better reflects fish abundance/biomass at high temperature. From a technical standpoint, higher levels of eDNA were captured with glass fiber (GF) than mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters and support the importance of adequate filters to quantify fish abundance based on the eDNA method. This study supports the importance of including water temperature in fish abundance/biomass prediction models based on eDNA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Some studies have suggested that odors from a predator whose diet includes the target species are more effective than odors from a predator that does not consume the species. To evaluate this management tool in the Australian context and to determine the effect, if any, of predator diet on odor repellence, we tested eutherian and metatherian, predator fecal odors on phylogenetically separated pest species that currently occur in Australia. We evaluated fecal odors from tigers (Panthera tigris) and Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) as repellents for goats (Capra hircus) and eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus). We fed tigers and Tasmanian devils 2 diets: one of goat and one of eastern grey kangaroo. The test fecal odors were more effective than a control odor of carrier material and solvent at deterring goats (P {\textless} 0.001) and kangaroos (P = 0.02) from food. Tiger fecal odor was more effective than Tasmanian devil odor in deterring both goats (P = 0.001) and kangaroos (P = 0.03). We observed a decrease in the number of feeding events for goats when they were exposed to the odor from a tiger fed goat compared with all other predator-diet combinations (P {\textless} 0.001). We also observed a decrease in feeding events for kangaroos when exposed to the odor from a tiger fed kangaroo compared with all other predator-diet combinations. We observed signs of desensitization to the test odors in goats and habituation to the test odors in kangaroos over the experimental period. A better understanding of the factors involved in desensitization and habituation may increase the effectiveness of fecal odor-based repellents as a humane and nonlethal management tool for managers.},

	abstract = {The deposition and accumulation of persistent contaminants into coastal systems can have lingering negative consequences for wildlife populations and their habitats. Using multi-locus genotyping of non-invasively collected feces, we assessed the effects of such pollution on reproduction, survival, genetic variability, and abundance of river otters (Lontra canadensis) along a gradient of urban-industrial development on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Genetic analyses indicated a pattern consistent with small-scale structuring, with individuals partitioned into 2 local subpopulationsa-those identified in the contaminated harbors of southern Vancouver Island and points west (Colwood/Harbors), and those inhabiting uncontaminated habitat east of the harbors (Oak Bay). Genetic and demographic analyses for the 2 clusters provide strong support for the conclusion that, despite contamination concerns, Colwood/Harbors river otters exhibited acceptable levels of survival and successfully reproduced (i.e., high levels of relatedness, high self-recruitment, and high emigration). However, our data indicate that the Colwood/Harbors area constitutes lower quality habitat supporting lower densities of otters, especially during winter, and excess individuals produced in that region emigrate to other areas. Immigration into Colwood/Harbors, however, seems limited, possibly because of behavioral aversion of non-habituated otters to anthropogenic disturbance associated with the harbors and limited optimal otter habitat. Our findings suggest that the effects of chronic contaminant exposure at the population level may be inadvertently mitigated through the behavioral decisions of individuals to avoid poor quality habitats. We conclude that populations of river otters can persist in and around locally contaminated sites if relatively less disturbed and contaminated habitats remain in the vicinity of the affected areas. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

	abstract = {Population sex ratio is an important metric for wildlife management and conservation, but estimates can be difficult to obtain, particularly for sexually monomorphic species or for species that differ in detection probability between the sexes. Noninvasive genetic sampling (NGS) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a common method for identifying sex from sources such as hair, feathers or faeces, and is a potential source for estimating sex ratio. If, however, PCR success is sex-biased, naively using NGS could lead to a biased sex ratio estimator. We measured PCR success rates and error rates for amplifying the W and Z chromosomes from greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) faecal samples, examined how success and error rates for sex identification changed in response to faecal sample exposure time, and used simulation models to evaluate precision and bias of three sex assignment criteria for estimating population sex ratio with variable sample sizes and levels of PCR replication. We found PCR success rates were higher for females than males and that choice of sex assignment criteria influenced the bias and precision of corresponding sex ratio estimates. Our simulations demonstrate the importance of considering the interplay between the sex bias of PCR success, number of genotyping replicates, sample size, true population sex ratio and accuracy of assignment rules for designing future studies. Our results suggest that using faecal DNA for estimating the sex ratio of sage-grouse populations has great potential and, with minor adaptations and similar marker evaluations, should be applicable to numerous species.},

Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important as pollinators; however, some species have recently suffered severe declines and range contractions across much of Western Europe and North America. We investigated whether bumblebee faeces could be used for the extraction of DNA suitable for genotyping using microsatellite markers. We found that DNA could be extracted using a Chelex method from faecal samples collected either in microcapillary tubes or on filter paper, directly from captured individuals. Our results show that genotypes scored from faecal samples are identical to those from tissue samples. This study describes a reliable, consistent and efficient noninvasive method of obtaining DNA from bumblebees for use in population genetic studies. This approach should prove particularly useful in breeding and conservation programs for bumblebees and may be broadly applicable across insect taxa.},

	abstract = {Understanding community assembly and population dynamics frequently requires detailed knowledge of food web structure. For many consumers, obtaining precise information about diet composition has traditionally required sacrificing animals or other highly invasive procedures, generating tension between maintaining intact study populations and knowing what they eat. We developed 16S mitochondrial DNA sequencing methods to identify arthropods in the diets of generalist vertebrate predators without requiring a blocking primer. We demonstrate the utility of these methods for a common Caribbean lizard that has been intensively studied in the context of small island food webs: Anolis sagrei (a semi-arboreal 'trunk-ground' anole ecomorph). Novel PCR primers were identified in silico and tested in vitro. Illumina sequencing successfully characterized the arthropod component of 168 faecal DNA samples collected during three field trips spanning 12 months, revealing 217 molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) from at least nine arthropod orders (including Araneae, Blattodea, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera). Three mOTUs (one beetle, one cockroach and one ant) were particularly frequent, occurring in ≥50\% of samples, but the majority of mOTUs were infrequent (180, or 83\%, occurred in ≤5\% of samples). Species accumulation curves showed that dietary richness and composition were similar between size-dimorphic sexes; however, female lizards had greater per-sample dietary richness than males. Overall diet composition (but not richness) was significantly different across seasons, and we found more pronounced interindividual variation in December than in May. These methods will be generally useful in characterizing the diets of diverse insectivorous vertebrates.},

Direct shotgun sequencing of fecal DNA could give information on these simultaneously, but this approach is largely untested. Here we used two fecal samples to characterize the diet of two Red-Shanked Doucs Langurs (Pygathrix nemaeus) that were fed known foliage, fruits, vegetables and cereals. Illumina HiSeq produced {\textasciitilde}74 and 67 million paired reads for these samples, of which {\textasciitilde}10000 (0.014\%) and {\textasciitilde}44000 (0.066\%) respectively corresponded to chloroplast genomes. Sequences were matched against a database of available chloroplast 'barcodes' for angiosperms. The results were compared with 'metabarcoding' using PCR amplification of the P6 loop of trnL. Metagenomics identified 7 and 9 of the likely 16 diet plants, against 6 and 5 identified by metabarcoding. Metabarcoding produced thousands of reads consistent with the known diet, but the barcodes were too short to identify several plants to genus. Metagenomics utilized multiple, longer barcodes that combined had greater power of identification, but rare diet items were not recovered. Read numbers for diet species in metagenomic and metabarcoding data were correlated, indicating that both are useful for determining relative sequence abundance. Metagenomic reads were uniformly distributed across the chloroplast genomes; thus if chloroplast genomes are used as reference, the precision of identifications and species recovery would improve further. Metagenomics also recovered the host mitochondrial genome and numerous intestinal parasite sequences in addition to generating data useful for characterizing the microbiome.

We present protocols for processing fecal and swab samples into amplicon libraries amenable to Illumina sequencing. We developed and tested a novel metagenomic DNA extraction approach using solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) bead technology on fecal and swab samples collected from Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). We compared the performance of the SPRI-based extraction protocol with that of the Mo Bio PowerSoil Kit, the current standard for the Human Microbiome Project and the Earth Microbiome Project. The SPRI-based method produced comparable PCR amplification success from fecal extractions but significantly outperformed the PowerSoil Kit in DNA quality, quantity, and PCR success for both cloacal and oral swab samples. We furthermore modified published protocols for preparing highly multiplexed Illumina libraries with minimal sample loss and without post-adapter ligation amplification. Our library preparation protocol was successfully validated on three sets of heterogeneous amplicons (derived from SPRI, PowerSoil, and control extractions of avian fecal and swab samples) that were sequenced across three independent, 250 bp, paired-end runs on Illumina's MiSeq platform. Our comprehensive strategies focus on maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs. In addition to increasing the feasibility of using minimally invasive sampling and NGS capabilities in avian research, our methods are notably not avian-specific and thus applicable to many research programs that involve DNA extraction and amplicon sequencing},

This study compared the effectiveness of morphological and DNA-based analysis for determining the diet of a free-ranging generalist predator, the arrow squid (Nototodarus gouldi). A combined approach was more effective than using either of the methods in isolation. Nineteen unique prey taxa were identified, of which six were found by both methods, 10 were only detected using DNA and three were only identified using morphological methods. Morphological techniques only found 50\% of the total number of identifiable prey taxa, whereas DNA-based techniques found 84\%.

	abstract = {DNA sourced from faeces is notoriously less reliable than that from tissue. Hence, understanding whether faecal pellet quality varies within faecal piles may be important for sample selection. We hypothesized that the order in which faecal pellets are deposited may influence microsatellite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification success from sampled faeces, more specifically, that first pellets deposited will have signatures of greater success than later ones. In a first test of the hypothesis, first and later-deposited pellets, as determined from the direction of footprints, were collected from fresh (overnight) faecal piles of northern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus krefftii). DNA extracts were typed for seven microsatellite loci. We found that faecal deposition order significantly affected optical density of bands on autoradiographs (a measure of PCR amplification success) when the first faecal pellet was compared with the last one, but not when the first pellet was only distinguishable from later ones. The absence of a difference in amplification rate between first and later pellets is likely a reflection of the overall high amplification success in this study. That first pellets deposited yield more product suggests they contain more intestinal cells. Although further comparisons are needed, these results may inform sample selection in species for which success of microsatellite PCR amplification of faecal DNA is low. Deposition order may have more of an impact on amplification success and genotyping errors as faecal age increases.},

Both the hooded and white-naped cranes migrate in winter to Izumi in Kyushu, the southern island of Japan. In this study, we investigated the cranes and their coccidian parasites, through a targeted molecular approach using faecal DNA to develop a noninvasive method for infectious disease research. To determine the origin of noninvasively collected faecal samples, host species were identified by sequencing a region of approximately 470 bp of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene in the faecal DNA. Furthermore, to avoid sample redundancy, individual determination was performed by fragment analysis using microsatellite and sex-linked markers. For microsatellite genotyping, previously reported markers and markers isolated in this study were examined, and seven loci for red-crowned cranes, eight for hooded cranes and six for white-naped cranes displayed polymorphisms. A low error rate was demonstrated by comparing microsatellite data generated from faecal DNA samples with that generated from feather DNA samples, indicating a high reliability. Polymerase chain reaction-based capillary electrophoresis (PCR-CE), employing genetic markers in the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, was employed to detect crane coccidia. The sensitivity of detection of PCR-CE using faecal DNA was inferior to that with traditional microscopy; however, our results suggest that PCR-CE can depict crane coccidia diversity with higher resolution and it is a useful tool to characterize community composition of coccidia in detail.},

The effect of storage type and time on nuclear DNA concentrations, genotyping errors and percentage recovery of consensus genotypes was also examined. Regardless of storage method, mitochondrial and nuclear amplification success was high in DNA extracted within the first week after collection. Over longer storage periods, RNAlater yielded better amplification success rates in the mitochondrial assay. However, samples stored on silica showed (i) highest nuclear DNA concentrations, (ii) best microsatellite genotyping success, (iii) lowest genotyping errors, and (iv) greatest percentage recovery of the consensus genotype. The quantity of nuclear DNA was generally a good predictor of microsatellite performance with 83\% amplification success or greater achieved with sample DNA concentrations of ≥ 50 pg/µL. If faecal DNA samples are to be used for nuclear microsatellite analyses, we recommend silica as the best storage method. However, for maximum mitochondrial amplification success, RNAlater appears to be the best storage medium. In contrast, ethanol appeared inferior to the other two methods examined here and should not be used to store tropical ungulate faeces. Regardless of storage method, samples should be extracted as soon as possible after collection to ensure optimal recovery of DNA.},

	abstract = {In noninvasive genetic sampling, when genotyping error rates are high and recapture rates are low, misidentification of individuals can lead to overestimation of population size. Thus, estimating genotyping errors is imperative. Nonetheless, conducting multiple polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) at multiple loci is time-consuming and costly. To address the controversy regarding the minimum number of PCRs required for obtaining a consensus genotype, we compared consumer-style the performance of two genotyping protocols (multiple-tubes and 'comparative method') in respect to genotyping success and error rates. Our results from 48 faecal samples of river otters (Lontra canadensis) collected in Wyoming in 2003, and from blood samples of five captive river otters amplified with four different primers, suggest that use of the comparative genotyping protocol can minimize the number of PCRs per locus. For all but five samples at one locus, the same consensus genotypes were reached with fewer PCRs and with reduced error rates with this protocol compared to the multiple-tubes method. This finding is reassuring because genotyping errors can occur at relatively high rates even in tissues such as blood and hair. In addition, we found that loci that amplify readily and yield consensus genotypes, may still exhibit high error rates (7-32\%) and that amplification with different primers resulted in different types and rates of error. Thus, assigning a genotype based on a single PCR for several loci could result in misidentification of individuals. We recommend that programs designed to statistically assign consensus genotypes should be modified to allow the different treatment of heterozygotes and homozygotes intrinsic to the comparative method.},

	abstract = {The development of DNA barcoding from faeces represents a promising method for animal diet analysis. However, current studies mainly rely on prior knowledge of prey diversity for a specific predator rather than on a range of its potential prey species. Considering that the feeding behaviour of teleosts may evolve with their environment, it could prove difficult to establish an exhaustive listing of their prey. In this article, we extend the DNA barcoding approach to diet analysis to allow the inclusion of a wide taxonomic range of potential prey items. Thirty-four ecological clade-specific primer sets were designed to cover a large proportion of prey species found in European river ecosystems. Selected primers sets were tested on isolated animal, algal or plant tissues and thereafter on fish faeces using nested PCR to increase DNA detection sensitivity. The PCR products were sequenced and analysed to confirm the identity of the taxa and to validate the method. The methodology developed here was applied to a diet analysis of three freshwater cyprinid species that are assumed to have similar feeding behaviour [Chondrostoma toxostoma toxostoma (Vallot 1837), Chondrostoma nasus nasus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Barbus barbus, (Linneaus 1758)]. These three species were sampled in four different hydrographic basins. Principal Component Analysis based on prey proportions identified distinct perilithon grazer and benthophagous behaviours. Furthermore, our results were consistent with the available literature on feeding behaviour in these fish. The simplicity of the PCR-based method and its potential generalization to other freshwater organisms may open new perspectives in food web ecology.},

	abstract = {Many studies in molecular ecology rely upon the genotyping of large numbers of low-quantity DNA extracts derived from noninvasive or museum specimens. To overcome low amplification success rates and avoid genotyping errors such as allelic dropout and false alleles, multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) replicates for each sample are typically used. Recently, two-step multiplex procedures have been introduced which drastically increase the success rate and efficiency of genotyping. However, controversy still exists concerning the amount of replication needed for suitable control of error. Here we describe the use of a two-step multiplex PCR procedure that allows rapid genotyping using at least 19 different microsatellite loci. We applied this approach to quantified amounts of noninvasive DNAs from western chimpanzee, western gorilla, mountain gorilla and black and white colobus faecal samples, as well as to DNA from {\textasciitilde}100-year-old gorilla teeth from museums. Analysis of over 45 000 PCRs revealed average success rates of {\textgreater} 90\% using faecal DNAs and 74\% using museum specimen DNAs. Average allelic dropout rates were substantially reduced compared to those obtained using conventional singleplex PCR protocols, and reliable genotyping using low ({\textless} 25 pg) amounts of template DNA was possible. However, four to five replicates of apparently homozygous results are needed to avoid allelic dropout when using the lowest concentration DNAs ({\textless} 50 pg/reaction), suggesting that use of protocols allowing routine acceptance of homozygous genotypes after as few as three replicates may lead to unanticipated errors when applied to low-concentration DNAs.},

We sequenced the mitochondrial control region from 75 individuals belonging to 11 species of Arvicolinae from Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy, and an additional 19 sequences from ten Microtus species from other countries were downloaded from Genbank. Based on these control region sequences, we successfully designed and applied a nested PCR for M. cabrerae-specific and arvicolid-generic mtDNA markers to differentiate Cabrera's vole faecal samples among other species of the Arvicolinae subfamily.

In the UK and elsewhere, reptiles are legally required to be relocated before land development can proceed, but without knowledge of their dietary requirements, the suitability of receptor sites cannot be known. Here, we tested the ability of non-invasive DNA-based molecular diagnostics (454 pyrosequencing) to analyse reptile diets, with the specific aims of determining which earthworm species are exploited by slow worms (the legless lizard Anguis fragilis) and whether they feed on the deeper-living earthworm species that only come to the surface at night. Slow worm faecal samples from four different habitats were analysed using earthworm-specific PCR primers.We found that 86\% of slow worms (N = 80) had eaten earthworms. In lowland heath and marshy⁄acid grassland, Lumbricus rubellus, a surface-dwelling epigeic species, dominated slowworm diet. In two other habitats, riverside pasture and calcif- erous coarse grassland, diet was dominated by deeper-living anecic and endogeic species. We conclude that all species of earthwormare exploited by these reptiles and lack of specialization allows slow worms to thrive in a wide variety of habi- tats. Pyrosequencing of prey DNA in faeces showed promise as a practical, rapid and relatively inexpensive means of obtaining detailed and valuable ecological information on the diets of reptiles.},

A major part of the noninvasive genetic literature is dedicated to the search for optimal protocols, by comparing different methods of collection, preservation and extraction of DNA from noninvasive materials. However, the lack of quantitative comparisons among these studies and the possibility that different methods are optimal for different systems make it difficult to decide which protocol to use. Moreover, most studies that have compared different methods focused on a single factor – collection, preservation or extraction – while there could be interactions between these factors. We designed a factorial experiment, as a pilot study, aimed at exploring the effect of several collection, preservation and extraction methods, and the interactions between them, on the quality and amplification success of DNA obtained from Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) faeces in Israel. The amplification success rates of one mitochondrial DNA and four microsatellite markers differed substantially as a function of collection, preservation and extraction methods and their interactions. The most efficient combination for our system integrated the use of swabs as a collection method with preservation at −20 °C and with the Qiagen DNA Stool Kit with modifications as the DNA extraction method. The significant interaction found between the collection, preservation methods and the extraction methods reinforces the importance of conducting a factorial design experiment, rather than examining each factor separately, as a pilot study before initiating a full-scale noninvasive research project.},

However, it is poorly known how gut transition time, environmental factors and laboratory treatments such as storage conditions or DNA extraction procedures affect the detection success of prey DNA. Here, we examined several of these factors using faeces from carrion crows fed with insect larvae. Faeces produced between 30 min and 4 h post-feeding tested positive for insect DNA, representing the gut transition time. Prey detection was not only possible in fresh but also in 5-day-old faeces. The type of surface the faeces were placed on for these 5 days, however, affected prey DNA detection success: samples placed on soil provided the lowest rate of positives compared to faeces left on leaves, on branches and within plastic tubes. Exposing faeces to sunlight and rain significantly lowered prey DNA detection rates (17\% and 68\% positives in exposed and protected samples, respectively). Storing faeces in ethanol or in the freezer did not affect molecular prey detection. Extracting DNA directly from larger pieces of faecal pellets resulted in significantly higher prey detection rates than when using small amounts of homogenized faeces. A cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide-based DNA extraction protocol yielded significantly higher DNA detection rates (60\%) than three commercial kits, however, for small amounts of homogenized faeces only. Our results suggest that collecting faeces from smooth, clean and non-absorbing surfaces, protected from sunlight and rain, improves DNA detection success in avian faeces.},

	abstract = {DNA methods are useful to identify ingested prey items from the gut of predators, but reliable detection is hampered by low amounts of degraded DNA. PCR-based methods can retrieve minute amounts of starting material but suffer from amplification biases and cross-reactions with the predator and related species genomes. Here, we use PCR-free direct shotgun sequencing of total DNA isolated from the gut of the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis at five time points after feeding on a single pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Sequence reads were matched to three reference databases: Insecta mitogenomes of 587 species, including H. axyridis sequenced here; A. pisum nuclear genome scaffolds; and scaffolds and complete genomes of 13 potential bacterial symbionts. Immediately after feed- ing, multicopy mtDNA of A. pisum was detected in tens of reads, while hundreds of matches to nuclear scaffolds were detected. Aphid nuclear DNA and mtDNA decayed at similar rates (0.281 and 0.11 h?1 respectively), and the detectability periods were 32.7 and 23.1 h. Metagenomic sequencing also revealed thousands of reads of the obligate Buchnera aphidicola and facultative Regiella insecticola aphid symbionts, which showed exponential decay rates sig- nificantly faster than aphid DNA (0.694 and 0.80 h?1, respectively). However, the facultative aphid symbionts Hamil- tonella defensa, Arsenophonus spp. and Serratia symbiotica showed an unexpected temporary increase in population size by 1–2 orders of magnitude in the predator guts before declining. Metagenomics is a powerful tool that can reveal complex relationships and the dynamics of interactions among predators, prey and their symbionts.},

Intensive habitat loss and modification have increased the vulnerability of pygmy rabbit populations, but the current geographic distribution and population status remain unclear. To aid in detection and population monitoring, we developed a species identification test that uses mitochondrial DNA species-specific primers to distinguish among six sympatric lagomorph species using DNA isolated from faecal pellets. Applying this test, we successfully identified the species of origin for all pellet samples that produced a positive PCR result (77\% of 283 pellets collected). Pellets collected during the winter (December-February) had higher PCR success rate (93\%) than pellets collected at other times of the year (72\%). This test, using non-invasive genetic sampling of faecal pellets, provides an efficient method for assessing site occupancy and distribution of pygmy rabbits and other lagomorphs across large geographic areas.},

	abstract = {While the morphological identification of prey remains in predators' faeces is the most commonly used method to study trophic interactions, many studies indicate that this method does not detect all consumed prey. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods are increasingly used to detect prey DNA in the predator food bolus and have proven efficient, delivering highly accurate results. When studying complex diet samples, the extraction of total DNA is a critical step, as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors may be co-extracted. Another critical step involves a careful selection of suitable group-specific primer sets that should only amplify DNA from the targeted prey taxon. In this study, the food boluses of five Rattus rattus and seven Rattus exulans were analysed using both morphological and molecular methods. We tested a panel of 31 PCR primer pairs targeting bird, invertebrate and plant sequences; four of them were selected to be used as group-specific primer pairs in PCR protocols. The performances of four DNA extraction protocols (QIAamp(®) DNA stool mini kit, DNeasy(®) mericon food kit and two of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-based methods) were compared using four variables: DNA concentration, A(260) /A(280) absorbance ratio, food compartment analysed (stomach or faecal contents) and total number of prey-specific PCR amplification per sample. Our results clearly indicate that the A(260) /A(280) absorbance ratio, which varies between extraction protocols, is positively correlated to the number of PCR amplifications of each prey taxon. We recommend using the DNeasy(®) mericon food kit (QIAGEN), which yielded results very similar to those achieved with the morphological approach.},

The method was optimized with samples of known origin (14 blood and 15 fresh faeces) and validated in faecal samples of unknown origin (n = 138), for some of which (n = 40) we also obtained species identification based on mtDNA sequencing. This approach proved reliable and provides high identification success rates from faeces.

In this study we used DNA isolated from field-collected faecal samples to estimate the size of a population of common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) surviving in suburban Melbourne parkland. A pilot study revealed that microsatellite genotypes obtained from DNA in faeces were often incorrect, but that by carrying out three replicate polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for each sample, we were able to reliably identify individuals. We conducted a mark-recapture study using the Mh-jackknife model to estimate the size of the wombat population at Mt Lofty Reserve, and identified 17 individuals - 10 males and seven females. The interpolated population size estimate was 19 with a 95\% confidence interval of 18-32. The distribution of individual wombats' scats provided information on ranging behaviour. The genotypic database obtained was used to identify five of the individuals as putative immigrants, suggesting that the population is not isolated from others in a series of reserves along the Yarra River. However, the lack of a detectable female bias in immigration differs from our previous findings in continuous populations of this species. The level of genetic variation at the five loci analysed was also inconsistent with long-term isolation of the population.},

In order to scale up our encoding, we propose a sam-pling scheme via random partitioning of the search space us-ing parity functions.

The reviewed studies examined the differences between training methods (e.g., methods based on positive reinforcement, positive punishment, escape/avoidance, et cetera) on a dog's physiology, welfare, and behavior toward humans and other dogs. The reviewed studies included surveys, observational studies, and interventions. The results show that using aversive training methods (e.g., positive punishment and negative reinforcement) can jeopardize both the physical and mental health of dogs. In addition, although positive punishment can be effective, there is no evidence that it is more effective than positive reinforcement–based training. In fact, there is some evidence that the opposite is true. A few methodological concerns arose from the reviewed studies. Among them are small sample sizes, missing data on effect size, possible bias when coding behavior in observational studies, and the need to publish case reports of bodily damage caused by aversive training methods. In conclusion, those working with or handling dogs should rely on positive reinforcement methods and avoid using positive punishment and negative reinforcement as much as possible.},

Closed capture-recapture models (CR) based on the recognition of individuals and incorporating natural heterogeneity in cap- ture probabilities are considered robust tools; however, closure assumption is often ques- tionable and the use of anMh jackknife estimator may fail in estimations of real abundance when the heterogeneity is high and data is sparse. A novel, spatially explicit capture-recap- ture (SECR) approach based on the location-specific capture histories of individuals over- comes the limitations of closedmodels.We applied both methods on a closed population of 16 critically endangered Western Derby elands in the fenced 1,060-ha Fathala reserve, Senegal.We analyzed the data from 30 cameras operating during a 66-day sampling period deployed in two densities in grid and line arrays. We captured and identified all 16 individu- als in 962 trap-days. Abundances were estimated in the programs CAPTURE (modelsM0, Mh andMh Chao) and R, package secr (basic Null and Finite mixture models), and com- pared with the true population size.Wespecified 66 days as a threshold in which SECRpro- vides an accurate estimate in all trapping designs within the 7-times divergent density from 0.004 to 0.028 camera trap/ha. Both SECR models showed uniform tendency to overesti- mate abundance when sampling lasted shorter with no major differences between their out- puts. Unlike the closed models, SECR performed well in the line patterns, which indicates promising potential for linear sampling of properly defined habitats of non-territorial and identifiable herbivores in dense wooded savanna conditions. The CR models provided reli- able estimates in the grid and we confirmed the advantage ofMh Chao estimator overMh jackknife when data appeared sparse. We also demonstrated the pooling of trapping occa- sions with an increase in the capture probabilities, avoiding violation of results},

	abstract = {Quantifying environmental crime and the effectiveness of policy interventions is difficult because perpetrators typically conceal evidence. To prevent illegal uses of natural resources, such as poaching endangered species, governments have advocated granting policy flexibility to local authorities by liberalizing culling or hunting of large carnivores. We present the first quantitative evaluation of the hypothesis that liberalizing culling will reduce poaching and improve population status of an endangered carnivore. We show that allowing wolf (Canis lupus) culling was substantially more likely to increase poaching than reduce it. Replicated, quasi-experimental changes in wolf policies in Wisconsin and Michigan, USA, revealed that a repeated policy signal to allow state culling triggered repeated slowdowns in wolf population growth, irrespective of the policy implementation measured as the number of wolves killed. The most likely explanation for these slowdowns was poaching and alternative explanations found no support. When the government kills a protected species, the perceived value of each individual of that species may decline; so liberalizing wolf culling may have sent a negative message about the value of wolves or acceptability of poaching. Our results suggest that granting management flexibility for endangered species to address illegal behaviour may instead promote such behaviour.},

	abstract = {Population structure must be considered when developing mark-recapture (MR) study designs as the sampling of individuals from multiple populations (or subpopulations) may increase heterogeneity in individual capture probability. Conversely, the use of an appropriate MR study design which accommodates heterogeneity associated with capture-occasion varying covariates due to animals moving between ‘states’ (i.e. geographic sites) can provide insight into how animals are distributed in a particular environment and the status and connectivity of subpopulations. 2.The Multistate Closed Robust Design was chosen to investigate: 1) the demographic parameters of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) subpopulations in coastal and estuarine waters of Perth, Western Australia; and 2) how they are related to each other in a metapopulation. Using four years of year-round photo-identification surveys across three geographic sites, we accounted for heterogeneity of capture probability based on how individuals distributed themselves across geographic sites and characterized the status of subpopulations based on their abundance, survival and interconnection. 3.MSCRD models highlighted high heterogeneity in capture probabilities and demographic parameters between sites. High capture probabilities, high survival and constant abundances described a subpopulation with high fidelity in an estuary. In contrast, low captures, permanent and temporary emigration and fluctuating abundances suggested transient use and low fidelity in an open coastline site. 4.Estimates of transition probabilities also varied between sites, with estuarine dolphins visiting sheltered coastal embayments more regularly than coastal dolphins visited the estuary, highlighting some dynamics within the metapopulation. 6.Synthesis and applications. To date, bottlenose dolphin studies using mark-recapture approach have focussed on investigating single subpopulations. Here, in a heterogeneous coastal-estuarine environment, we demonstrated that spatially structured bottlenose dolphin subpopulations contained distinct suites of individuals and differed in size, demographics and connectivity. Such insights into the dynamics of a metapopulation can assist in local-scale species conservation. The MSCRD approach is applicable to species/populations consisting of recognizable individuals and is particularly useful for characterizing wildlife subpopulations that vary in their vulnerability to human activities, climate change or invasive species.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Atopy, the clinical definition of an immunoglobulin E (IgE) high-responder, can be documented either by the detection of IgE antibodies in serum or by a positive skin prick test. Epidemiological studies use different reaction sizes to define a skin test reaction as positive or negative. The aim of the study was to identify the best cut-off level for skin prick tests. METHOD: Using the data collected during the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECHRS I) the association of serum allergen-specific IgE and skin prick tests [Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p), cat, timothy grass and Cladosporium] were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of the 11 355 subjects (49.9\% men), with positive skin tests ranged from 10.4\% (cut-off {\textgreater}5 mm) to 20.9\% (cut-off {\textgreater}0 mm) for Der p, 3.5-10.2\% for cat, 9.3-16.6\% for timothy grass and 0.2 and 2.3\% for Cladosporium. For identifying subjects with detectable specific IgE ({\textgreater}0.35 kU/l) the most appropriate cut-off appeared to be over 0 mm for Der p, cat and timothy grass (Youden Index over 0.81). However, the relationship between serum IgE and skin prick test for Cladosporium was weak (Youden index under 0.56). CONCLUSION: In epidemiological studies, a single method may be chosen to assess allergenic sensitivity. A cut-off level of over 0 mm for skin prick tests was best at identifying those with allergen-specific IgE.},

This phenomenon is uncommon in tetrapods, being restricted mostly to parrots and marine turtles. We report fluorescence in amphibians, in the tree frog Hypsiboas punctatus, showing that fluorescence in living frogs is produced by a combination of lymph and glandular emission, with pigmentary cell filtering in the skin. The chemical origin of fluorescence was traced to a class of fluorescent compounds derived from dihydroisoquinolinone, here named hyloins. We show that fluorescence contributes 18-29\% of the total emerging light under twilight and nocturnal scenarios, largely enhancing brightness of the individuals and matching the sensitivity of night vision in amphibians. These results introduce an unprecedented source of pigmentation in amphibians and highlight the potential relevance of fluorescence in visual perception in terrestrial environments.},

The rebounding brown bear Ursus arctos population in Sweden is monitored by two different systems, both relying on voluntary resources. Population estimates have been calculated using Capture-Mark-Recapture methods, based on DNA-based scat surveys in five of the six Swedish counties with established bear populations. A total of 1,358 genotypes were identified using DNA extracted from collected scats. An independent ongoing programme, the Large Carnivore Observation Index (LCOI), was initiated in 1998. The LCOI uses effort-corrected observations of bears by moose Alces alces hunters during the moose hunt ({\textgreater} 2 million observation hours/year) and has shown a good correlation with relative population density of bears using the DNA-based method. From this, we have calculated population trends during the period 1998-2007. Using an exponential model, we estimated the yearly increase in the bear population to be 4.5\% at the national level, varying between 0 and 10.2\% in different counties. We used the regional population estimates and the trends from the LCOI, taking the variation from both systems into account using parametric bootstrapping, to calculate the regional as well as the national population size in Sweden in fall 2008. In one case (the northernmost county; Norrbotten) a DNA-scat survey was lacking, so we used assumptions based on data from the neighbouring county to estimate population size. We estimated the Swedish brown bear population to be 3,298 individuals (2,968-3,667; 95\% confidence intervals) in 2008. Our results suggest that reliable information, necessary for the management of the brown bear population can be obtained from volunteers using standardised methods. © Wildlife Biology, NKV.},

We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity of a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals, and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity.

	abstract = {With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone, We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, RiskShrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink mimics the performance of an oracle for selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log(2) n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variable-knot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone.},

Trapped adult males had less tendency to leave study areas than adult females, but juvenile males had the most tendency to leave. Movement away was not related to body weight at 1st capture. Initial ranges of juveniles were larger than those of adults. At an estate where 4,000 ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) are released annually, hawk capture rates and density, hawk weights, and rate of predation on pheasants were greater, and ranges smaller, than at an estate with only wild pheasants. Goshawks were responsible for an estimated 88\% of the 64\% overwinter loss among female wild pheasants, and for 23\% of the 76\% loss among males. The predation showed no marked selection of pheasants in poor condition, but females were selected when the ground was covered with snow. When all kills probably were found, male goshawks ate 133 g/day and females 189 g/day. Wild pheasants accounted for an estimated 43\% of the males' food, whereas European hares (Lepus capensis) comprised 37\% of the diet of females.

	abstract = {We addressed the phylogeny of cockroaches using DNA sequence data from a broad taxon sample of Dictyoptera and other non-endopterygotan insect orders. We paid special attention to several taxa in which relationships are controversial, or where no molecular evidence has been used previously: Nocticolidae, a family of small, often cave-dwelling cockroaches, has been suggested to be the sister group of the predaceous Mantodea or of the cockroach family Polyphagidae; Lamproblatta, traditionally placed in Blattidae, has recently been given family status and placed as sister to Polyphagidae; and Saltoblattella montistabularis Bohn, Picker, Klass \& Colville, a jumping cockroach, which has not yet been included in any phylogenetic studies. We used mitochondrial (COI + COII and 16S) and nuclear (18S and 28S) genes, and analysed the data using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML). Nocticolidae was recovered as sister to Polyphagidae. Lamproblatta was recovered as sister to Blattidae, consistent with the traditional placement (not based on phylogenetic analysis). However, because of the limited support for this relationship and conflict with earlier morphology-based phylogenetic hypotheses, we retain Lamproblattidae. S. montistabularis was consistently placed as sister to Ectobius sylvestris Poda (Blaberoidea: Ectobinae), indicating that the saltatorial hindlegs of this genus are a relatively recent adaptation. Isoptera was placed within Blattodea as sister to Cryptocercidae. Nocticolidae + Polyphagidae was sister to Isoptera + Cryptocercidae, and Blaberoidea was sister to the remaining Blattodea.},

The threatened population in northwestern Montana, USA, has been managed for recovery since 1975; yet, no rigorous data were available to monitor program success. We used data from a large noninvasive genetic sampling effort conducted in 2004 and 33 years of physical captures to assess abundance, distribution, and genetic health of this population. We combined data from our 3 sampling methods (hair trap, bear rub, and physical capture) to construct individual bear encounter histories for use in Huggins–Pledger closed mark–recapture models. Our population estimate, Nˆ ¼765 (95\% CI ¼ 715–831) was more than double the existing estimate derived from sightings of females with young. Based on our results, the estimated known, human-caused mortality rate in 2004 was 4.6\% (95\% CI ¼ 4.2–4.9\%), slightly above the 4\% considered sustainable; however, the high proportion of female mortalities raises concern. We used location data from telemetry, confirmed sightings, and genetic sampling to estimate occupied habitat. We found that grizzly bears occupied 33,480 km2 in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) during 1994–2007, including 10,340 km2 beyond the Recovery Zone. We used factorial correspondence analysis to identify potential barriers to gene flow within this population. Our results suggested that genetic interchange recently increased in areas with low gene flow in the past; however, we also detected evidence of incipient fragmentation across the major transportation corridor in this ecosystem. Our results suggest that the NCDE population is faring better than previously thought, and they highlight the need for a more rigorous monitoring program.},

Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. * We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. * Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

The two dominant methods in this area are capture-recapture (CR) and distance sampling (DS), each with its own largely separate literature. We develop a class of models that synthesizes them. It accommodates a spectrum of models ranging from nonspatial CR models (with no information on animal locations) through to DS and mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models, in which animal locations are observed without error. Between these lie spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models that include only capture locations, and a variety of models with less location data than are typical of DS surveys but more than are normally used on SECR surveys. In addition to unifying CR and DS models, the class provides a means of improving inference from SECR models by adding supplementary location data, and a means of incorporating measurement error into DS and MRDS models. We illustrate their utility by comparing inference on acoustic surveys of gibbons and frogs using only capture locations, using estimated angles (gibbons) and combinations of received signal strength and time-of-arrival data (frogs), and on a visual MRDS survey of whales, comparing estimates with exact and estimated distances.

	abstract = {Recovering small populations of threatened species is an important global conservation strategy. Monitoring the anticipated recovery, however, often relies on uncertain abundance indices rather than on rigorous demographic estimates. To counter the severe threat from poaching of wild tigers (Panthera tigris), the Government of Thailand established an intensive patrolling system in 2005 to protect and recover its largest source population in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. Concurrently, we assessed the dynamics of this tiger population over the next 8 years with rigorous photographic capture-recapture methods. From 2006 to 2012, we sampled across 624–1026 km 2 with 137–200 camera traps. Cameras deployed for 21,359 trap days yielded photographic records of 90 distinct individuals. We used closed model Bayesian spatial capture-recapture methods to estimate tiger abundances annually. Abundance estimates were integrated with likelihood-based open model analyses to estimate rates of annual and overall rates of survival, recruitment, and changes in abundance. Estimates of demographic parameters fluctuated widely: annual density ranged from 1.25 to 2.01 tigers/100 km 2 , abundance from 35 to 58 tigers, survival from 79.6\% to 95.5\%, and annual recruitment from 0 to 25 tigers. The number of distinct individuals photographed demonstrates the value of photographic capture–recapture methods for assessments of population dynamics in rare and elusive species that are identifiable from natural markings. Possibly because of poaching pressure, overall tiger densities at Huai Kha Khaeng were 82–90\% lower than in ecologically comparable sites in India. However, intensified patrolling after 2006 appeared to reduce poaching and was correlated with marginal improvement in tiger survival and recruitment. Our results suggest that population recovery of low-density tiger populations may be slower than anticipated by current global strategies aimed at doubling the number of wild tigers in a decade.

	abstract = {Impact assessments often focus on short-term behavioral responses of animals to human disturbance. However, the cumulative effects caused by repeated behavioral disruptions are of management concern because these effects have the potential to influence individuals’ survival and reproduction. We need to estimate individual exposure rates to disturbance to determine cumulative effects. We present a new approach to estimate the spatial exposure of minke whales to whalewatching boats in Faxaflói Bay, Iceland. We used recent advances in spatially explicit capture–recapture modeling to estimate the probability that whales would encounter a disturbance (i.e., whalewatching boat). We obtained spatially explicit individual encounter histories of individually identifiable animals using photo-identification. We divided the study area into 1-km2 grid cells and considered each cell a spatially distinct sampling unit. We used capture history of individuals to model and estimate spatial encounter probabilities of individual minke whales across the study area, accounting for heterogeneity in sampling effort. We inferred the exposure of individual minke whales to whalewatching vessels throughout the feeding season by estimating individual whale encounters with vessels using the whale encounter probabilities and spatially explicit whalewatching intensity in the same area, obtained from recorded whalewatching vessel tracks. We then estimated the cumulative time whales spent with whalewatching boats to assess the biological significance of whalewatching disturbances. The estimated exposure levels to boats varied considerably between individuals because of both temporal and spatial variations in the activity centers of whales and the whalewatching intensity in the area. However, although some whales were repeatedly exposed to whalewatching boats throughout the feeding season, the estimated cumulative time they spent with boats was very low. Although whalewatching boat interactions caused feeding disruptions for the whales, the estimated low cumulative exposure indicated that the whalewatching industry in its current state likely is not having any long-term negative effects on vital rates.},

To date, few studies have explored the performance of genetic CR estimates by implementing them in a population of known size. We evaluated the accuracy and precision of genetic CR estimates by genotyping fecal samples collected opportunistically over the territory of a well-studied group of approximately 190 previously identified and genotyped eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We compared the performance of genetic CR estimates based on 3-month and 3-year sampling periods to explore the impact of lengthened sample periods, which are expected to increase accuracy and precision of estimates but also increase the chances of violating population closure assumptions. We compared the effects of using spatial and non-spatial models and equal or heterogeneous detection probabilities upon estimates. Over the 3-year period, we detected 54\% of the group members and produced population size estimates with more accuracy and narrower confidence intervals than the 3-month sampling period. The population remained effectively closed over the 3 years and detection heterogeneity was linked to age but not sex. Non-spatial methods estimated group size more accurately than spatially explicit methods, which had a stronger tendency to underestimate population size. This study suggests that genetic CR may produce accurate and precise population size estimates if substantial effort is allocated to sample collection and genotyping.},

	abstract = {High throughput sequencing of phylogenetic and functional gene amplicons provides tremendous insight into the structure and functional potential of complex microbial communities. Here, we introduce a highly adaptable and economical PCR approach to barcoding and pooling libraries of numerous target genes. In this approach, we replace gene- and sequencing platform-specific fusion primers with general, interchangeable barcoding primers, enabling nearly limitless customized barcode-primer combinations. Compared to barcoding with long fusion primers, our multiple-target gene approach is more economical because it overall requires lower number of primers and is based on short primers with generally lower synthesis and purification costs. To highlight our approach, we pooled over 900 different small-subunit rRNA and functional gene amplicon libraries obtained from various environmental or host-associated microbial community samples into a single, paired-end Illumina MiSeq run. Although the amplicon regions ranged in size from approximately 290 to 720 bp, we found no significant systematic sequencing bias related to amplicon length or gene target. Our results indicate that this flexible multiplexing approach produces large, diverse and high quality sets of amplicon sequence data for modern studies in microbial ecology.},

The platform is manageable and affordable even for smaller labs. This enables quick turnaround on a broad range of applications such as targeted gene sequencing, metagenomics, small genome sequencing and clinical molecular diagnostics. However, Illumina error profiles are still poorly understood and programs are therefore not designed for the idiosyncrasies of Illumina data. A better knowledge of the error patterns is essential for sequence analysis and vital if we are to draw valid conclusions. Studying true genetic variation in a population sample is fundamental for understanding diseases, evolution and origin. We conducted a large study on the error patterns for the MiSeq based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data. We tested state-of-the-art library preparation methods for amplicon sequencing and showed that the library preparation method and the choice of primers are the most significant sources of bias and cause distinct error patterns. Furthermore we tested the efficiency of various error correction strategies and identified quality trimming (Sickle) combined with error correction (BayesHammer) followed by read overlapping (PANDAseq) as the most successful approach, reducing substitution error rates on average by 93\%.},

We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

To establish whether genotyping of greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) individuals from faecal pellets collected in the field can be useful for population monitoring, an understanding of the DNA degradation rates is necessary. To determine the relationship between time and degradation of bilby faecal DNA, and assess whether a two-step elution process during extraction results in better-quality DNA, faecal pellets were collected from captive individuals, maintained under seminatural conditions, then harvested at known periods. DNA was amplified from faecal pellets with a 99\% success rate and error rates of less than 5\% up to 14 days after deposition. The amplification rate decreases, and the rate of allelic dropout increases with time, but DNA can still be amplified at rates above 60\% and error rates below 15\% at 90–180 days. We found that a second elution step was unnecessary, with more DNA amplified over a longer period using the first eluate. Viable DNA exists on bilby faecal pellets for a long period after deposition, which is useful for obtaining genetic samples for population monitoring programs and studies on population genetics.},

Understanding wolf social structure and population dynamics and predicting their future range expansion is mandatory to design sound conservation strategies, but field monitoring methods are difficult or exceedingly expensive. Noninvasive genetic sampling offers unique opportunities for the reliable monitoring of wolf populations. We conducted a 9-year-long monitoring program in a large area (approximately 19,171 km 2) in northern Italy, aiming to identify individuals, estimate kinship, reconstruct packs, and describe their dynamics. Of 5,065 biological samples (99\% scats), we genotyped and sexed 44\% reliably using 12 unlinked autosomal microsatellites, 4 Y-linked microsatellites, and a diagnostic mitochondrial DNA control-region sequence. We identified 414 wolves, 88 dogs, and 16 wolf 3 dog hybrids. Wolves in the study area belonged to at least 42 packs. We reconstructed the genealogy of 26 packs. The mean pack size was 5.6 6 2.4 SD, including adoptees, with a mean minimum pack home range of 74 km 2 6 52 SD. We detected turnovers of breeding pairs in 19\% of the packs. Reproductive wolves were unrelated and unrelated dispersers founded new packs, except for 1 pack founded by a brother–sister pair. We did not detect multiple breeding females in any packs. Overall, the population was not inbred. We found significant isolation by distance and spatial autocorrelation, with nonrandom genetic structure up to a distance of approximately 17 km. We detected 37 dispersers, 14 of which became breeders in new or already existing packs. Our results can be used to model habitat use by wolves, to estimate survival rates, to predict future expansion of the wolf population, and to build risk maps of wolf–human conflicts.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) is increasingly used to estimate the abundance of rare or elusive species such as the wolf (Canis lupus), which cannot be directly counted in forested mountain habitats. Wolf individual and familial home ranges are wide, potentially connected by long-range dispersers, and their populations are intrinsically open. Appropriate demographic estimators are needed, because the assumptions of homogeneous detection probability and demographic closeness are violated. We compiled the capture-recapture record of 418 individual wolf genotypes identified from ca. 4,900 non-invasive samples, collected in the northern Italian Apennines from January 2002 to June 2009. We analysed this dataset using novel capture-recapture multievent models for open populations that explicitly account for individual detection heterogeneity (IDH). Overall, the detection probability of the weakly detectable individuals, probably pups, juveniles and migrants (P = 0. 08), was ca. six times lower than that of the highly detectable wolves (P = 0. 44), probably adults and dominants. The apparent annual survival rate of weakly detectable individuals was lower (Φ = 0. 66) than those of highly detectable wolves (Φ = 0. 75). The population mean annual finite rate of increase was λ = 1. 05 0. 11, and the mean annual size ranged from N = 117 wolves in 2003 to N = 233 wolves in 2007. This procedure, combining large-scale NGS and multievent IDH demographic models, provides the first estimates of abundance, multi-annual trend and survival rates for an open large wolf population in the Apennines. These results contribute to deepen our understanding of wolf population ecology and dynamics, and provide new information to implement sound long-term conservation plans. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Lynx fed mostly on hares, roe deer and birds (usually tetraonids) year-round. However, the share of roe deer in lynx diet increased significantly during the period of its higher abundance and the share of tetraonids decreased with their decreasing numbers. There was also a remarkable increase of lynx population, which followed that of the roe deer, despite the pronounced decline of tetraonids.

	abstract = {The frequency of black bear (Ursus americanus) sightings, vehicle collisions, and nuisance incidents in the coastal region of South Carolina has increased over the past 4 decades. To develop the statewide Black Bear Management and Conservation Strategy, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources needed reliable information for the coastal population. Because no such data were available, we initiated a study to determine population density and genetic structure of black bears. We selected 2 study areas that were representative of the major habitat types in the study region: Lewis Ocean Bay consisted primarily of Carolina Bays and pocosin habitats, whereas Carvers Bay was representative of extensive pine plantations commonly found in the region. We established hair snares on both study areas to obtain DNA from hair samples during 8 weekly sampling periods in 2008 and again in 2009. We used genotypes to obtain capture histories of sampled bears. We estimated density using spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) models and used information-theoretic procedures to fit parameters for capture heterogeneity and behavioral responses and to test if density and model parameters varied by year. Model-averaged density was 0.046?bears/km2 (SE?=?0.011) for Carvers Bay and 0.339?bears/km2 (SE?=?0.056) for Lewis Ocean Bay. Next, we sampled habitat covariates for all locations in the SECR sampling grid to derive spatially explicit estimates of density based on habitat characteristics. Addition of habitat covariates had substantial support, and accounted for differences in density between Carvers Bay and Lewis Ocean Bay; black bear density showed a negative association with the area of pine forests (4.5-km2 scale) and a marginal, positive association with the area of pocosin habitat (0.3-km2 scale). Bear density was not associated with pine forest at a smaller scale (0.3-km2), nor with major road density or an index of largest patch size. Predicted bear densities were low throughout the coastal region and only a few larger areas had high predicted densities, most of which were centered on public lands (e.g., Francis Marion National Forest, Lewis Ocean Bay). We sampled a third bear population in the Green Swamp area of North Carolina for genetic structure analyses and found no evidence of historic fragmentation among the 3 sampled populations. Neither did we find evidence of more recent barriers to gene exchange; with the exception of 1 recent migrant, Bayesian population assignment techniques identified only a single population cluster that incorporated all 3 sampled areas. Bears in the region may best be managed as 1 population. If the goal is to maintain or increase bear densities, demographic connectivity of high-density areas within the low-density landscape matrix is a key consideration and managers would need to mitigate potential impacts of planned highway expansions and anticipated development. Because the distribution of black bears in coastal South Carolina is not fully known, the regional map of potential black bear density can be used to identify focal areas for management and sites that should be surveyed for occupancy or where more intensive studies are needed.

We estimated sex-dependent detection probabilities and population size using a modern spatial capture-recapture (SCR) model for the data from pooled sur- veys. A total of 127 capercaillie genotypes were identified (77males, 46 females, and 4 of unknown sex). The SCR model yielded atotal population size estimate (posterior mean) of 137.3 capercaillies (posterior sd 4.2, 95\% CRI 130–147). The observed sex ratio was skewed towards males (0.63). The posterior mean of the sex ratio under the SCR model was 0.58 (posterior sd 0.02, 95\% CRI 0.54–0.61), suggesting a male-biased sex ratio in our study area. A subsampling simulation study indicated that a reduced sampling effort repre- senting 75\% of the actual detections would still yield practically acceptable estimates of total size and sex ratio in our population. Hence, field work and financial effort could be reduced without compromising accuracy when the SCR model is used to estimate key pop- ulation parameters of cryptic species.},

	abstract = {The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.},

	abstract = {Ancient DNA studies have revolutionised the study of extinct species and populations, providing insights on phylogeny, phylogeography, admixture and demographic history. However, inferences on behaviour and sociality have been far less frequent. Here, we investigate the complete mitochondrial genomes of extinct Late Pleistocene cave bears and middle Holocene brown bears that each inhabited multiple geographically proximate caves in northern Spain. In cave bears, we find that, although most caves were occupied simultaneously, each cave almost exclusively contains a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes. This remarkable pattern suggests extreme fidelity to their birth site in cave bears, best described as homing behaviour, and that cave bears formed stable maternal social groups at least for hibernation. In contrast, brown bears do not show any strong association of mitochondrial lineage and cave, suggesting that these two closely related species differed in aspects of their behaviour and sociality. This difference is likely to have contributed to cave bear extinction, which occurred at a time in which competition for caves between bears and humans was likely intense and the ability to rapidly colonise new hibernation sites would have been crucial for the survival of a species so dependent on caves for hibernation as cave bears. Our study demonstrates the potential of ancient DNA to uncover patterns of behaviour and sociality in ancient species and populations, even those that went extinct many tens of thousands of years ago.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive genetic sampling is an important tool in wildlife ecology and management, typ- ically relying on hair snaring or scat sampling techniques, but hair snaring is labor and cost intensive, and scats yield relatively low quality DNA. New approaches utilizing environmen- tal DNA (eDNA) may provide supplementary, cost-effective tools for noninvasive genetic sampling. Wetested whether eDNA from residual saliva on partially-consumed Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses might yield suitable DNA quality for noninvasive monitoring of brown bears (Ursus arctos).We compared the efficiency of monitoring brown bear populations using both fecal DNA and salivary eDNA collected from partially-con- sumed salmon carcasses in Southeast Alaska.We swabbed a range of tissue types from 156 partially-consumed salmon carcasses from a midseason run of lakeshore-spawning sockeye (O. nerka) and a late season run of stream-spawning chum (O. keta) salmon in 2014.We also swabbed a total of 272 scats from the same locations. Saliva swabs col- lected from the braincases of salmon had the best amplification rate, followed by swabs taken from individual bite holes. Saliva collected from salmon carcasses identified unique individuals more quickly and required much less labor to locate than scat samples. Salmon carcass swabbing is a promising method to aid in efficient and affordable monitoring of bear populations, and suggests that the swabbing of food remains or consumed baits from other animals may be an additional cost-effective and valuable tool in the study of the ecol- ogy and population biology of many elusive and/or wide-ranging species.},

Yet imperfect detection and other phenomena that cause zero inflation can induce estimation error and obscure ecological patterns. * Recent statistical advances provide an increasingly diverse array of analytical approaches for estimating population size to address these phenomena. * We examine how detection error and zero inflation in count data inform the choice of analytical method for estimating population size of unmarked individuals that are not uniquely identified. We review two established (GLMs and distance sampling) and nine emerging methods that use N-mixture models (Royle–Nichols model, and basic, zero inflated, temporary emigration, beta-binomial, generalized open-population, spatially explicit, single visit and multispecies) to estimate abundance of unmarked populations, focusing on their requirements and how each method accounts for imperfect detection and zero inflation. * Eight of the emerging methods can account for both imperfect detection and additional variation in population size in the forms of non-occupancy, temporary emigration, correlated detection and population dynamics. * Methods differ in sampling design requirements (e.g. count vs. detection/non-detection data, single vs. multiple visits, covariate data), and their suitability for a particular study will depend on the characteristics of the study species, scale and objectives of the study, and financial and logistical considerations. * Most emerging methods were developed over the past decade, so their efficacy is still under study, and additional statistical advances are likely to occur.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics. Nanopore sequencing has many attractive properties including the ability to detect single DNA molecules without prior amplification, the lack of reliance on expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence very long fragments. The MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialised and made available to early-access users. The MinION(TM) is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer which permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. A cloud-based service is available to translate events into nucleotide base calls. However, software support to deal with such data is limited, and the community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets. Results: We introduce poretools, a flexible toolkit for manipulating and exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (a variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools. Availability and implementation: Poretools is open source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code and user documentation are freely available in Github at https://github.com/arq5x/poretools Contact: n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk, aaronquinlan@gmail.com Supplementary information: An IPython notebook demonstrating the use and functionality of poretools in greater detail is available from the Github repository.},

Distance and multiple-observer methods require the sometimes unlikely assumption that all birds in the population are available (i.e., sing or are visible) during a count, but the time-ofdetection method allows for the possibility that some birds are unavailable during the count. We combined the dependent double-observer method with the time-of-detection method and obtained field-based estimates of the components of detection probability for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). Our approach was a special case of Pollock's robust capture-recapture design where the probability that a bird does not sing is analogous to the probability that an animal is a temporary emigrant. Top models indicated that observers' detection probabilities were similar (0.78-0.84) if bobwhite were available, but bobwhite only had an approximately 0.61 probability of being available during a 2.5-minute sampling interval. Additionally, observers' detection probabilities increased substantially after the initial encounter with an individual bobwhite (analogous to a traphappy response on the part of the observer). A simulated data set revealed that the combined method was precise when availability and detection given availability were substantially lower. Combined methods approaches can provide critical information for researchers and land managers to make decisions regarding survey length and personnel requirements for point-count— based surveys.},

As the most inclusive genetic analysis of giraffe relationships to date, the findings highlight the need for targeted conservation efforts of the world's tallest megafauna. SUMMARY Traditionally, one giraffe species and up to eleven subspecies have been recognized [1]; however, nine subspecies are commonly accepted [2]. Even after a century of research, the distinctness of each giraffe subspecies remains unclear, and the genetic variation across their distribution range has been incompletely explored. Recent genetic studies on mtDNA have shown reciprocal monophyly of the matrilines among seven of the nine assumed subspecies [3, 4]. More-over, until now, genetic analyses have not been applied to biparentally inherited sequence data and did not include data from all nine giraffe subspecies. We sampled natural giraffe populations from across their range in Africa, and for the first time individuals from the nominate subspecies, the Nubian giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis Linnaeus 1758 [5], were included in a genetic analysis. Coales-cence-based multi-locus and population genetic ana-lyses identify at least four separate and monophyletic clades, which should be recognized as four distinct giraffe species under the genetic isolation criterion. Analyses of 190 individuals from maternal and bipa-rental markers support these findings and further sug-gest subsuming Rothschild's giraffe into the Nubian giraffe, as well as Thornicroft's giraffe into the Masai giraffe [6]. A giraffe survey genome produced valuable data from microsatellites, mobile genetic elements, and accurate divergence time estimates. Our findings provide the most inclusive analysis of giraffe relation-ships to date and show that their genetic complexity has been underestimated, highlighting the need for greater conservation efforts for the world's tallest mammal.},

	abstract = {A new ordination method, called co-correspondence analysis, is developed to relate two types of communities (e.g., a plant community and an animal community) sampled at a common set of sites in a direct way. The method improves the simple, indirect approach of applying correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging) to the separate species data sets and correlating the resulting ordination axes. Co-correspondence analysis maximizes the weighted covariance between weighted averaged species scores of one community and weighted averaged species scores of the other community. It thus attempts to identify the. patterns that are common to both communities. Both a symmetric descriptive, and an asymmetric predictive form are developed. The symmetric form relates to co-inertia analysis and the asymmetric, predictive form to partial least-squares regression. In two examples the predictive power of co-correspondence analysis is compared with that of canonical correspondence analyses on syntaxonomic and environmental data. In the first example, carabid beetles in roadside verges are shown to be more closely related to plant species composition than to vegetation structure (biomass, height, roughness, among others), and, in the second example, bryophytes in spring meadows are shown to be more closely related to the species composition of the vascular plants than to the measured water chemistry.},

	abstract = {Population monitoring of wildlife species requires techniques that produce estimates with low bias and adequate precision. Use of infrared- triggered camera (hereaſter; camera) surveys for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) population density estimation is popular among land managers. However, current camera surveys do not provide an estimate of precision critical for accurate density estimation. We believed that incorpo- rating spatial aspects of sampling into the analytical process would allow for both estimates of precision associated with density and an ability to calcu- late effective sample area. We conducted camera surveys for deer in Units 1 (1,385 ha) and 2 (1,488 ha) at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee, in August 2010. We used 1 camera per 53 and 62 ha in Units 1 and 2, respectively, and identified individual male deer based on antler criteria. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) data with Program DENSITY to fit a spatial detection function (g0; probability of detecting an individual on a single occasion when the distance between their home range center and a trap is zero) and sigma (the scale parameter that determines the rate at which detec- tion probability decreases with distance between a home range center and a trap) to estimate antlered male density. Density estimates were similar be- tween camera surveys (based on recaptures of recognizable antlered males from camera images) using traditional sampling techniques (without spatial information on capture) and spatially explicit density estimation (with a record of location for each individual camera capture). Antlered male density estimates obtained via traditional sampling for Units 1 and 2 were 2.0 and 2.6 males/km2 , respectively. Density estimates based on SECR models were 1.6 males/km2 (SE = 0.33, g0 = 0.24) for Unit 1 and 2.5 males/km2 (SE = 0.56, g0 = 0.14) for Unit 2. Both estimation methods indicated lower deer density in Unit 1 versus Unit 2. Analysis of camera surveys using SECR modeling uses the data from the spatial distribution of cameras and does not require the assumption of equal detectability. Use of SECR modeling can improve current camera survey methods by providing both a measure of precision that is currently lacking from traditional camera analysis methods and including spatial distribution of captured deer. Spatial modeling should be explored further to enhance our understanding of potential biases associated with behavioral responses to the use of bait as an attractant.},

We also introduce a weighting scheme to estimate density on habitats that are not covered by survey transects, assuming thatmovement data on a subset of individuals is available.We test the performanceof spatio-temporaland temporal approaches by a simu- lation study mimicking the Finnish winter track count survey. The results illustrate how the spatio-temporal modelling approach is able to borrowinformation from observationsmade on neighboring locations and times when estimating population density, and that spatio- temporal and temporal smoothing models can provide improved estimates of total popula- tion size compared to theFMPmethod.},

We used noninvasive hair sampling at 4 proximal study areas along the Kentucky–Virginia, USA, border during 2012–2013 to estimate demographics and population genetics, and investigate recolonization patterns of an American black bear population that was founded by 55 bears reintroduced to a fragmented mountainous landscape during the 1990s and subjected to harvest 6 years post- reintroduction.Using spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models,we estimated a density of 0.26 bear/ km2, or minimum abundance of 482 bears, distributed among 2 primary core areas previously identified by occupancy analysis: a southern and northerncore area.Thesouthern core area was established by a founder adult female that exhibited post-release dispersal, but moderate asymmetrical gene flow (Nm¼6 bears) from the northern core areamitigated deleterious genetic consequences typical of such founder events. Effectivenumber of breeders (NB¼62 bears) was similar to the number of founders, suggesting that genetically, the population remainsmostly the product of reintroduction.Despite limited connectivity withotherpopulations in the region, genetic diversity (HE¼0.78) was retained because of rapid population growth during the 16 years post- reintroduction (l¼1.14/year). This bear population exhibited demographic characteristics indicative of continued recolonization, including a significantly female-biased sex ratio (0.53M:1.00F) and female density decreasing with increasing distance from the reintroduction release areas in the northern core. Few bear detectionsat2peripheral studyareasandresults fromSECRmodeldetectionfunctiontransformationsuggested recolonizationmaycontinue to the southwest and northeast along prominent linearmountain ridges. Although the population has grown and is genetically stable, because of relatively low population density and recolonization direction, we suggest monitoring demographic vital rates to evaluate harvest sustainability and population viability. Our study demonstrates the utility of noninvasive genetic sampling in conjunction with SECR models to characterize and monitor recolonizing bear populations, which may also be useful for management of expanding populations of other large carnivores.},

	abstract = {Estimating wildlife population size is fundamental for wildlife management and conservation. However, making monitoring of population size less resource demanding while still keeping a high monitoring accuracy and precision remains a recurrent challenge. One proposed alternative to count individuals is to instead focus on counting a segment of the population that is easier to monitor but at the same time well informative on total population size. We show how total population size can be estimated from group counts by using an individual-based population model in a social living species. We developed a wolf (Canis lupus) specific Individual Based Model and used Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit this population model to the time series of annual number of packs, reproductions and pairs obtained from Scandinavian monitoring data. Model informative priors were obtained with data from collared individuals by the Scandinavian wolf research project. The fitted model was then used to estimate a conversion factor from number of packs to total number of individuals and to number of reproductions. There was a good fit between the retained simulations by ABC and the observed Scandinavian wolf population trajectory. The fitted simulations returned a conversion factor of 8.0 (95\% CI = 6.62–10.07) from number of packs to total population size and of 1.0 (95\% CI = 0.93–1.12) to number of reproductions in December. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the conversion factor from packs to total population size was positively correlated with pup survival and litter size and negatively correlated with subadult, vagrant and adult survivals. Using an individual based model allowed us to model the full complexity of demographic traits of a social-living species such as the wolf. The flexibility of the model also meant that the conversion factor could be estimated for any month during the year. Our approach to estimate total population size from counts of groups requires having a population model where both individuals and groups are explicitly described and can be applied to other wolf populations and group-living species where counting all individuals over a large area is unfeasible.},

	abstract = {American black bears are closely associated with forest habitat. They were nearly extirpated from the Central Interior Highlands, United States, in the early twentieth century, but have recolonized this part of the range since the 1960s. Due to lower population densities (as a result of recent recolonization), we hypothesized that bears in this region would show strong associations with forest habitat at both the home range and landscape scale. To test this, we analyzed hair snare and GPS telemetry data from five sampling grids with a combined spatial capture–recapture and resource selection function model to investigate individual space use within home ranges and landscape scale variation in density of black bears in the southern Missouri part of the Interior Highlands. We performed a linear discriminant analysis to identify habitat correlates of black bear density. We found that at the home range level, bears selected for more forested habitat and steeper slopes. Black bear density varied among sampling grids from 0.842 to 10.248 individuals/100 km2 which is at the low end of the spectrum of reported black bear densities. There were no clear habitat correlates for among-grid variation in density, but in the three higher-density grids, density declined with increasing forest cover and increasing distance from human settlements. This suggests that the bear populations benefited from more heterogeneous habitat and that rural settlements may represent food resources. Exploiting these anthropogenic resources could be facilitated by the fact that bears in our study were not hunted and were viewed as a novelty rather than a nuisance, which may lead to low perceived risk from anthropogenic sources. Our results highlight the need to interpret habitat associations of American black bears not only at local scales but also in the landscape context.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Accurately estimating cougar (Puma concolor) density is usually based on long-term research consisting of intensive capture and Global Positioning System collaring efforts and may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Because wildlife agency budgets rarely accommodate this approach, most infer cougar density from published literature, rely on short-term studies, or use hunter harvest data as a surrogate in their jurisdictions; all of which may limit accuracy and increase risk of management actions. In an effort to develop a more cost-effective long-term strategy, we evaluated a research approach using citizen scientists with trained hounds to tree cougars and collect tissue samples with biopsy darts. We then used the DNA to individually identify cougars and employed spatially explicit capture–recapture models to estimate cougar densities. Overall, 240 tissue samples were collected in northeastern Washington, USA, producing 166 genotypes (including recaptures and excluding dependent kittens) of 133 different cougars (8–25/yr) from 2003 to 2011. Mark–recapture analyses revealed a mean density of 2.2 cougars/100 km2 (95\% CI = 1.1–4.3) and stable to decreasing population trends (β = −0.048, 95\% CI = −0.106–0.011) over the 9 years of study, with an average annual harvest rate of 14\% (range = 7–21\%). The average annual cost per year for field sampling and genotyping was US\$11,265 (\$422.24/sample or \$610.73/successfully genotyped sample). Our results demonstrated that long-term biopsy sampling using citizen scientists can increase capture success and provide reliable cougar-density information at a reasonable cost.},

Suicide is far more common than homicide and its rate is increasing; the homicide rate is decreasing. As with other important health problems, most cases of fatal firearm violence arise from large but low-risk subsets of the population; risk and burden of illness are not distributed symmetrically.

Camera trapping is a non-invasive sampling method allowing the use of capture-recapture (CR) models to estimate abundance while accounting for the difficulty of detecting individuals in the wild. We investigated the relative performance of standard closed CR models and spatially explicit CR models (SECR) that incorporate spatial information in the data. Using simulations, we considered 4 scenarios comparing low versus high detection probability and small versus large populations and contrasted abundance estimates obtained from both approaches. Standard CR and SECR models both provided minimally biased abundance estimates, but precision was improved when using SECR models. The associated confidence intervals also provided better coverage than their non-spatial counterpart. We concluded SECR models exhibit better statistical performance than standard closed CR models and allow for sound management strategies based on density maps of activity centers. To illustrate the comparison, we considered the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) as a case study that provided the first abundance estimates of a local population in France. © The Wildlife Society, 2012.},

	abstract = {Sightings of previously marked animals can extend a capture-recapture dataset without the added cost of capturing new animals for marking. Combined marking and resighting methods are therefore an attractive option in animal population studies, and there exist various likelihood-based non-spatial models, and some spatial versions fitted by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. As implemented to date, the focus has been on modeling sightings only, which requires that the spatial distribution of pre-marked animals is known. We develop a suite of likelihood-based spatial mark-resight models that either include the marking phase ("capture-mark-resight" models) or require a known distribution of marked animals (narrow-sense "mark-resight"). The new models sacrifice some information in the covariance structure of the counts of unmarked animals; estimation is by maximizing a pseudolikelihood with a simulation-based adjustment for overdispersion in the sightings of unmarked animals. Simulations suggest that the resulting estimates of population density have low bias and adequate confidence interval coverage under typical sampling conditions. Further work is needed to specify the conditions under which ignoring covariance results in unacceptable loss of precision, or to modify the pseudolikelihood to include that information. The methods are applied to a study of ship rats Rattus rattus using live traps and video cameras in a New Zealand forest, and to previously published data. © 2017, The International Biometric Society.},

These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.},

	abstract = {Analyzing next-generation sequencing data is difficult because datasets are large, second generation sequencing platforms have high error rates, and because each position in the target genome (exome, transcriptome, etc.) is sequenced multiple times. Given these challenges, numerous bioinformatic algorithms have been developed to analyze these data. These algorithms aim to find an appropriate balance between data loss, errors, analysis time, and memory footprint. Typical analysis pipelines require multiple steps. If one or more of these steps is unnecessary, it would significantly decrease compute time and data manipulation to remove the step. One step in many pipelines is PCR duplicate removal, where PCR duplicates arise from multiple PCR products from the same template molecule binding on the flowcell. These are often removed because there is concern they can lead to false positive variant calls. Picard (MarkDuplicates) and SAMTools (rmdup) are the two main softwares used for PCR duplicate removal. Approximately 92 \% of the 17+ million variants called were called whether we removed duplicates with Picard or SAMTools, or left the PCR duplicates in the dataset. There were no significant differences between the unique variant sets when comparing the transition/transversion ratios (p = 1.0), percentage of novel variants (p = 0.99), average population frequencies (p = 0.99), and the percentage of protein-changing variants (p = 1.0). Results were similar for variants in the American College of Medical Genetics genes. Genotype concordance between NGS and SNP chips was above 99 \% for all genotype groups (e.g., homozygous reference). Our results suggest that PCR duplicate removal has minimal effect on the accuracy of subsequent variant calls.},

	abstract = {Abundance estimates for black bears (Ursus americanus) are important for effective management. Recently, DNA technology has resulted in widespread use of noninvasive, genetic capture-mark-recapture (CMR) approaches to estimate populations. Few studies have compared the genetic CMR methods to other estimation methods. We used genetic CMR to estimate the bear population at 2 study sites in northern New Hampshire (Pittsburg and Milan) in 2 consecutive years. We compared these estimates to those derived from traditional methods used by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFG) using hunter harvest and mortality data. Density estimates produced with genetic CMR methods were similar both years and were comparable to those derived from traditional methods. In 2006, the estimated number of bears in Pittsburg was 79 (95\% CI = 60-98) corresponding to a density of 15-24 (95\% CI) bears/100 km(2); the 2007 estimate was 83 (95\% CI = 67-99; density = 16-24 bears/100 km(2)). In 2006, the estimated number of bears in Milan was 95 (95\% CI = 74-117; density = 16-25 bears/100 km(2)); the 2007 estimate was 96 (95\% CI = 77-114; density = 17-25 bears/100 km(2)). We found that genetic CMR methods were able to identify demographic variation at a local scale, including a strongly skewed sex ratio (2 M: 1 F) in the Milan population. Genetic CMR is a useful tool for wildlife managers to monitor populations of local concern, where abundance or demographic characteristics may deviate from regional estimates. Future monitoring of the Milan population with genetic CMR is recommended to determine if the sex ratio bias continues, possibly warranting a change in local harvest regimes.

	abstract = {We used program CAPTURE to analyze 1,535 capture-recapture data sets from 33 species of small mammals for sources of variation in capture probabilities and to characterize species-specific responses to mark-recapture trapping. Program CAPTURE contains 8 models to account for all possible combinations of heterogeneity (h), behavioral response (b), and time (t) effects on capture probabilities. Model M[o] (equal capture probabilities) was selected most often by CAPTURE as the most appropriate model for small sample sizes, reflecting the difficulty of detecting unequal probabilities of capture in small data sets. Heterogeneity in capture probabilities among individuals was evident in larger data sets for all species of small mammals examined. Strong behavioral responses were detected in several species. Sylvilagus, Tamias amoenus, Glaucomys sabrinus, Perognathus longimembris, and Microtus ochrogaster were trap shy, whereas Tamias striatus, Tamias townsendii, Spermophilus richardsonii, Perognathus parvus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus truei, Sigmodon hispidus, Microtus californicus, and Microtus pennsylvanicus were trap prone. Time effects were not apparent for most species except where they were accompanied with heterogeneity. Murid species had the highest estimated probabilities of capture, followed by heteromyids, sciurids, and leporids in decreasing order. Estimates of abundance from model M[h] were significantly greater than those from models M[b], M[o], and M[t], which likely reflects the negative bias of these latter estimators.},

	abstract = {We developed a capture-mark-recapture protocol for measuring the population density (D) of ship rats (Rattus rattus) in forest. Either mesh cage traps or Elliott box traps were set at each of six sites (48 traps per site for 5 nights) in the Orongorongo Valley on two occasions in autumn 2003. Cage traps only were set at three sites in autumn 2004. Rats were caught much more readily in cage traps than in Elliott traps and none were recaptured in Elliott traps. Additional food, bedding and trap covers reduced mortality and interference with traps. To estimate density we fitted a spatial detection model; this method avoids the need to estimate effective trapping area. Estimates were based on both a model assuming equal capture probability (D) and a model incorporating temporal and individual variation (th th). Our target for precision was CV() ≤ 20\%, but when data were pooled from multiple sites with cage traps, CV(th th) was {\textasciitilde}30\%. Estimated density of rats (th th) was 5 ha –1 in 2003 and 9 ha –1 in 2004; these estimates did not differ significantly. The overall capture index in 2004 was 31 rats per 100 corrected trap-nights on snap-trap lines set after live trapping. House mice were caught in both types of live trap, but at rates high enough for density estimation only where Elliott traps were used. Field estimates of detection functions for rats captured with cage traps allowed us to simulate the performance of alternative trapping systems. We predict that a 64-trap layout at three sites with five trapping occasions would yield acceptable precision of th th (20–23\%) at the observed rat densities. Our use of th th was conservative; slightly higher precision may be achieved by assuming constant trappability (D), and future work may justify this assumption. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_},

	abstract = {Studies on carnivores, which are generally difficult to observe directly because they are elusive and nocturnal, are carried out through indirect methods, e.g., camera trapping and radiotracking. The first method has been used to estimate population densities of species that can be differentiated as individuals using unique pelage patterns. However, the use of capture–recapture methodology has raised doubts regarding the estimation of the sampling area around the camera traps, which is obtained using maximum distances traveled by individuals photographed at two or more different locations. In this paper, the results from camera traps are compared with a radiotracking study carried out simultaneously with ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) to confirm whether maximum distances observed in camera traps coincide with ranging patterns determined from radio telemetry, and in turn whether the sampling areas estimated from camera traps are appropriate for estimating density. Mean maximum distance moved was 2880 m according to camera trap records during a 60-d survey period while, with radiotracking, the maximum distance moved was 3176 m during the same period. The difference is not significant, and the sampling areas estimated with camera traps to assess ocelot density are reliable. However, if the area covered by cameras is reduced to less than three to four times average home range for the target species, then density estimates from camera trapping are exaggerated because of the reduced observed distances and the fact that multiple individuals can overlap in relatively small areas.},

	doi = {10.4404/hystrix-28.2-12141},
	abstract = {Population size is a highly important parameter for wildlife management and conservation. How- ever, its estimation can be challenging when a portion of the population is undetectable. Spatially explicit capture-recapture models are a precise approach to estimate wildlife population density while accounting for imperfect detection, but all animals must be individually identifiable. Spatial mark-resight models (SMR) allow the estimation of population sizes when only some individuals can be identified. This is the case in feral pigs (Sus scrofa), where some individuals are recog- nizable by natural marks. We compared two SMR approaches to estimate feral pig population density: SMR for an unknown number of marked individuals (SMR-UM) and SMR for a known number of marked individuals (SMR-KM). Both approaches are applicable in species with some in- dividuals recognisable by natural marks, such as feral pigs. The SMR-KM is similar to a process of capture-mark-recapture of fewer individuals, which can be used in species with non-recognisable in- dividuals (e.g., wild boar, S. scrofa). First, we fitted a SMR-UM using the complete capture history (individuals/traps/days) for all recognisable individuals (n=33) and the latent capture history (traps- days) for unmarked individuals throughout the entire sampling occasion (66 days). Secondly, we fitted SMR-KM dividing the sampling occasions into two periods: the sighting period (25 days) to identify individuals (n=13), and the resighting period (41 days) in whichwe used the complete cap- ture and latent capture histories of the marked and unmarked individuals, respectively. We estim- ated very similar densities with the two approaches for feral pigs in our study area: 13.27 (SD=3.07) (8.12–20.02 95\% BCI) and 12.87 (SD=2.21) (8.96–17.59 95\% BCI) pigs/km2, for SMR-UM and SMR-KM, respectively. Our results indicate that SMR models are an effective tool to monitor feral pig populations, as well as similar non-individually identifiable species, by tagging a small sample of the population.},

However, little is known about spatial variation in population density within adjoining farmland habitats or how this relationship varies seasonally.

	abstract = {We use methods in the program MARK to explore the effects of closure violation when DNA-based mark-recapture methods are used to estimate grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations. Our approach involves the use of Pradel models in MARK to explore the relationship between recruitment, apparent survival rates, recapture rates, and distance between mean bear-capture locations and the edge of the sampling grid. If the population is demographically closed, it can be assumed that apparent survival estimates the fidelity of bears to the grid area and recruitment estimates rates of addition of bears to the grid area. A core bear population is defined from the Pradel analysis and is used to approximate the grid-based population size. The Huggins closed-population model in MARK is used to provide robust superpopulation estimates by explicitly modeling the relationship between capture probability and distance of bear-capture location from the grid edge. Data from a grizzly bear DNA-based mark-recapture inventory conducted in British Columbia is used to illustrate this method. The results of the Pradel analysis suggest that bears with mean capture locations within 10 km of the grid edge exhibit reduced fidelity rates and higher addition rates. Using the population of bears captured more than 10 km from the grid edge, a core-extrapolated estimate is derived, which is substantially lower than na?ìve CAPTURE superpopulation estimates. The Huggins model superpopulation estimate displays superior precision compared with CAPTURE model estimates. Our results illustrate the danger of naive interpretation of closed-model estimates. This method allows further inferences to be made concerning the spatial causes of closure violation, and the degree of bias caused by closure violation to be explored.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates 7 mark-recapture projects using grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) DNA from bait stations with hair snags in British Columbia, 1996-98. The emphasis of these projects was to estimate population size. We evaluate how well this objective was met in terms of mark-recapture assumptions and ultimate precision and bias of estimates. We used the Pradel model in program MARK to compare smaller grids and cells with more intensive hair-snag coverage to larger grids and cells. Assuming demographic closure, the Pradel model estimates fidelity, recapture rate, and immigration rate from each of the grids. Results from this analysis suggest (1) closure violation was more likely in smaller grids than larger grids, and (2) recapture rate decreased as cell area increased (and sample intensity decreased). Sex-specific differences were suggested but not verified due to large standard errors of Pradel parameter estimates. We used newer mixture models in program MARK to evaluate heterogeneity with each sampling design and produced meta-analysis population estimates. These estimates were compared with corresponding estimates from the program CAPTURE. Results suggest that heterogeneity is evident with all sampling designs and the newer mixture models provide higher precision than CAPTURE heterogeneity models in most cases. This study highlights the tradeoff in study design faced when designing DNA mark-recapture studies. Namely, intensive sampling using smaller cells is needed to detect and model individual heterogeneity, but smaller grids are most vulnerable to closure violations. Strategies to confront this issue, such as use of radiocollared bears to index movements, are suggested. We discuss applications of recently developed mark-recapture models to DNA, radiotelemetry, and other sources of data that estimate apparent survival, population rate of change, and movements of bears in sampling areas. We argue that use of these newer methods is the most advantageous step in the application of the DNA mark-recapture technique to bear populations.},

	abstract = {Statistical inference for capture–recapture studies of open animal populations typically relies on the assumption that all emigration from the studied population is per- manent. However, there are many instances in which this assumption is unlikely to be met. We define two general models for the process of temporary emigration: completely random and Markovian. We then consider effects of these two types of temporary emigration on Jolly–Seber estimators and on estimators arising from the full-likelihood approach to robust design data. Capture–recapture data arising from Pollock’s robust design provide the basis for ob- taining unbiased estimates of demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emi- gration, and for estimating the probability of temporary emigration.We present a likelihood- based approach to dealing with temporary emigration that permits estimation under different models of temporary emigration and yields tests for completely random and Markovian emigration. In addition, we use the relationship between capture probability estimates based on closed and open models under completely random temporary emigration to derive three ad hoc estimators for the probability of temporary emigration. Two of these should be especially useful in situations where capture probabilities are heterogeneous among indi- vidual animals. Ad hoc and full-likelihood estimators are illustrated for small-mammal capture–recapture data sets. We believe that these models and estimators will be useful for testing hypotheses about the process of temporary emigration, for estimating demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emigration, and for estimating probabilities of temporary emigration. These latter estimates are frequently of ecological interest as indicators of animal movement and, in some sampling situations, as direct estimates of breeding probabilities and proportions.},

	abstract = {Population density estimates were obtained for sympatric black bear (Ursus americanus) and brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations inhabiting a search area of 1,325 km√á‚Äö√ü in south-central Alaska. Standard capture-recapture population estimation techniques were modified to correct for lack of geograhic closure based on daily locations of radio-marked animals over a 7-day period. Calculated density estimates were based on available habitat in the search area (1,317 km√á‚Äö√ü for brown bears and 531 km√á‚Äö√ü for black bears). Calculated density was 2.79 brown bears/100 km√á‚Äö√ü (2.52-3.30 bears/100 km√á‚Äö√ü) and 8.97 black bears/100 km√á‚Äö√ü (7.74-10.21 km√á‚Äö√ü). Calculated 95\% confidence intervals were +- 13.7\% of the estimate for black bears and -9.8\% to +18.5\% of the estimate for brown bears. Probabilities of capture based on calculated sightability indices were not equal in some instances, so confidence intervals should be interpreted cautiously. Increasing the number of marked bears during the study period resulted in altered brown bears estimates and smaller confidence intervals, but because closure was a relatively good assumption for black bears in our study area, had little effect on black bear estimates or confidence intervals. When telemetry data were used to correct input values for lack of geographic closure, the Schnabel estimator and the mean of 7 separate daily estimates yielded estimates close to our results. We recommend the technique for additional testing as a method to objectively compare bear densities between different areas or between different times. These procedures may also be appropriate for use with other species.},

Our approach was to establish humanized glial chimeric mice using glial progenitor cells (GPCs) produced from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with childhood-onset SCZ. After neonatal implantation into myelin-deficient shiverer mice, SCZ GPCs showed premature migration into the cortex, leading to reduced white matter expansion and hypomyelination relative to controls. The SCZ glial chimeras also showed delayed astrocytic differentiation and abnormal astrocytic morphologies. When established in myelin wild-type hosts, SCZ glial mice showed reduced prepulse inhibition and abnormal behavior, including excessive anxiety, antisocial traits, and disturbed sleep. RNA-seq of cultured SCZ human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) revealed disrupted glial differentiation-associated and synaptic gene expression, indicating that glial pathology was cell autonomous. Our data therefore suggest a causal role for impaired glial maturation in the development of schizophrenia and provide a humanized model for its in vivo assessment.},

Results In this study, we consider the batch effect issue in the pattern detection among the samples, such as clustering, dimension reduction, and construction of networks between subjects. Instead of adjusting the original data matrices, we design an adaptive method to directly adjust the dissimilarity matrix between samples. In simulation studies, the method achieved better results recovering true underlying clusters, compared to the leading batch effect adjustment method ComBat. In real data analysis, the method effectively corrected distance matrices, and improved the performance of clustering algorithms.

	doi = {10.1007/s10586-017-1015-0},
	abstract = {Over the last several years, many sequence alignment tools have appeared and become popular for the fast evolution of next generation sequencing technologies. Obviously, researchers that use such tools are interested in getting maximum performance when they execute them in modern infrastructures. Today’s NUMA (Non-uniform memory access) architectures present major challenges in getting such applications to achieve good scalability as more processors/cores are used. The memory system in NUMA systems shows a high complexity and may be the main cause for the loss of an application’s performance. The existence of several memory banks in NUMA systems implies a logical increase in latency associated with the accesses of a given processor to a remote bank. This phenomenon is usually attenuated by the application of strategies that tend to increase the locality of memory accesses. However, NUMA systems may also suffer from contention problems that can occur when concurrent accesses are concentrated on a reduced number of banks. Sequence alignment tools use large data structures to contain reference genomes to which all reads are aligned. Therefore, these tools are very sensitive to performance problems related to the memory system. The main goal of this study is to explore the trade-offs between data locality and data dispersion in NUMA systems. We have performed experiments with several popular sequence alignment tools on two widely available NUMA systems to assess the performance of different memory allocation policies and data partitioning strategies. We find that there is not one method that is best in all cases. However, we conclude that memory interleaving is the memory allocation strategy that provides the best performance when a large number of processors and memory banks are used. In the case of data partitioning, the best results are usually obtained when the number of partitions used is greater, sometimes combined with an interleave policy.},

One of them is the presence of duplicated reads. Results. To infer the influence of different methods of removal of duplicated reads on estimation of gene expression in cancer genomics, we analyzed paired samples of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-tumor liver tissue. Four protocols of data analysis were applied to each sample: processing without deduplication, deduplication using a method implemented in SAMtools, and deduplication based on one or two molecular indices (MI). We also analyzed the influence of sequencing layout (single read or paired end) and read length. We found that deduplication without MI greatly affects estimated expression values; this effect is the most pronounced for highly expressed genes. Conclusion. The use of unique molecular identifiers greatly improves accuracy of RNA-seq analysis, especially for highly expressed genes. We developed a set of scripts that enable handling of MI and their incorporation into RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Deduplication without MI affects results of differential gene expression analysis, producing a high proportion of false negative results. The absence of duplicate read removal is biased towards false positives. In those cases where using MI is not possible, we recommend using paired-end sequencing layout.},

Sequencing reads ambiguously mapped to repetitive and low complexity regions can also be problematic for accurate assessment of the biological signal, yet their impact on sequencing data has not received much attention. We investigate how trimming the adapters, removing duplicates, and filtering out reads overlapping low complexity regions influence the significance of biological signal in RNA- and ChIP-seq experiments.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We assessed the effect of data processing steps on the alignment statistics and the functional enrichment analysis results of RNA- and ChIP-seq data. We compared differentially processed RNA-seq data with matching microarray data on the same patient samples to determine whether changes in pre-processing improved correlation between the two. We have developed a simple tool to remove low complexity regions, RepeatSoaker, available at https://github.com/mdozmorov/RepeatSoaker, and tested its effect on the alignment statistics and the results of the enrichment analyses.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Both adapter trimming and duplicate removal moderately improved the strength of biological signals in RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.

Here, we present the first global assessment of the importance of vertebrate pollinators in the reproductive success of selected flowering plants. Our meta-analysis of 126 experiments on animal-pollinated plants revealed that excluding vertebrate pollinators – but not insect pollinators – reduced fruit and/or seed production by 63\% on average. We found bat-pollinated plants to be more dependent on their respective vertebrate pollinators than bird-pollinated plants (an average 83\% reduction in fruit/seed production when bats were excluded, as compared to a 46\% reduction when birds were excluded). Plant dependence on vertebrate pollinators for fruit/seed production was greater in the tropics than at higher latitudes. Given the potential for substantial negative impacts associated with the loss of vertebrate pollinators, there is a clear need for prompt, effective conservation action for threatened flower-visiting vertebrate species. Additional research on how such changes might affect wider ecosystems is also required.},

However, estimating demographic parameters typically requires labor-intensive capture–recapture methods that are difficult to implement over large spatial extents. Spatially explicit integrated population models (IPMs) provide a solution by accommodating spatial capture–recapture (SCR) data collected at a small number of sites with survey data that may be collected over a much larger extent. We extended the spatial IPM framework to include a spatio-temporal point process model for recruitment, and we applied the model to 4 yr of SCR and distance-sampling data on Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis) near the southern extent of the species' breeding range in North Carolina, USA, where climate change is predicted to cause population declines and distributional shifts toward higher elevations.

	abstract = {Eusociality, one of the most complex forms of social organization, is thought to have evolved in several animal clades in response to competition for resources and reproductive opportunities. Several species of snapping shrimp in the genus Synalpheus, the only marine organisms known to exhibit eusociality, form colonies characterized by high reproductive skew, and aggressive territoriality coupled with cooperative defense. In eusocial Synalpheus colonies, individual reproduction is limited to female ‘queens’, whose fecundity dictates colony growth. Given that individual reproduction and defense are both energetically costly, individual and colony fitness likely depend on the optimal allocation of resources by these reproducing individuals towards these potentially competing demands. Synalpheus species, however, display varying degrees of eusociality, suggesting that reproducing females have adopted different strategies for allocation among reproduction and defense. Here, we use structural equation modeling to characterize the relationships between the allometry of queen reproductive capacity and defensive weaponry, and colony size in six eusocial Synalpheus species, estimating trade-offs between reproduction and defense. We document strong trade-offs between mass of the fighting claw (defense) and egg number (reproduction) in queens from weakly eusocial species, while the trade-off is reduced or absent in those from strongly eusocial species. These results suggest that in less cooperative species, intra-colony conflict selects for queen retention of weapons that have significant costs to fecundity, while reproducing females from highly eusocial species, i.e., those with a single queen, have been able to reduce the cost of weapons as a result of protection by other colony members.},

	abstract = {Mark-recapture studies of animals with large home ranges typically involve many individuals that routinely traverse study area boundaries. Radio-collars can be used to determine the number of marked animals available for capture, but if the recapture period is long, some animals may be present only part-time; treating these as full-time occupants would overestimate density. A density estimator proposed in this paper weights each animal by the proportion of time it spends on the study area during the recapture period. Summing these animal-equivalents yields an estimate of the average number of marked animals simultnaeously residing in the designated area. Likewise, animal-equivalents can be calculated for unmarked animals that are captured and radio-collared. These individuals may spend less time in the trapping area than previously marked animals, either because they live near the edge or are merley passing through. Probabilities of capture, thus, may differ between marked and unmarked animals, as well as among marked animals, depending on the size and location of their home range, and consquent differing lengths of exposure to traps. Defining each parameter in the Petersen equation in terms of summed animal-equivalents compensates for these differences. The need for this modification increases with increasing home range size relative to the size of the recapture area. An application of this technique with black bears (Ursus americanus) is presented.},

As carnivore populations recover and expand in North America, understanding how populations may recolonize human-dominated landscapes is an important goal for conservation. We empirically test whether a population of American black bear (Ursus americanus) recolonizing a developed landscape is responding to land cover, housing density, or the amount of intermixture between forest and housing as quantified by the Wildland Urban Interface. Housing density was the most supported spatially explicit mark-recapture model and indicated that bear density was highest among exurban housing densities. Mean estimated bear density in exurban areas (6–49 houses/km2) was 0.18 individuals/km2compared to 0.12 individuals/km2in rural areas ({\textless}6 houses/km2). Bear densities also declined to zero as development approached 50 houses/km2. We also tested for differences in sex ratio between more and less intensely developed areas, using hybrid mixture models. Sex ratios were significantly more male-biased in areas of higher housing density. Elevated bear densities provide evidence that exurban land-use can facilitate recolonization of black bears, yet high housing density may also limit the recovery of bear populations. Explicit relationships between land-use and bear density will allow managers to anticipate future population distribution, and areas where bears and people may come into frequent contact.},

Seventy-two octopuses were captured by baited traps and plastic pots, tagged with subcutaneous PIT-tags and released. Nineteen tagged individuals were recaptured in the same area over the study period (recapture rate: 26.4\%). Mean specific growth rate (SGR) was 0.82 ±0.11 day-1.

	abstract = {Recently introduced unmarked spatial capture-recapture (SCR), spatial mark-resight (SMR), and 2-flank spatial partial identity models (SPIM) extend the domain of SCR to populations or observation systems that do not always allow for individual identity to be determined with certainty. For example, some species do not have natural marks that can reliably produce individual identities from photographs, and some methods of observation produce partial identity samples as is the case with remote cameras that sometimes produce single flank photographs. These models share the feature that they probabilistically resolve the uncertainty in individual identity using the spatial location where samples were collected. Spatial location is informative of individual identity in spatially structured populations with home range sizes smaller than the extent of the trapping array because a latent identity sample is more likely to have been produced by an individual living near the trap where it was recorded than an individual living further away from the trap. Further, the level of information about individual identity that a spatial location contains is determined by two key ecological concepts, population density and home range size. The number of individuals that could have produced a latent or partial identity sample increases as density and home range size increase because more individual home ranges will overlap any given trap. We show this uncertainty can be quantified using a metric describing the expected magnitude of uncertainty in individual identity for any given population density and home range size, the Identity Diversity Index (IDI). We then show that the performance of latent and partial identity SCR models varies as a function of this index and produces imprecise and biased estimates in many high IDI scenarios when data are sparse. We then extend the unmarked SCR model to incorporate partially identifying covariates which reduce the level of uncertainty in individual identity, increasing the reliability and precision of density estimates, and allowing reliable density estimation in scenarios with higher IDI values and with more sparse data. We illustrate the performance of this "categorical SPIM" via simulations and by applying it to a black bear data set using microsatellite loci as categorical covariates, where we reproduce the full data set estimates with only slightly less precision using fewer loci than necessary for confident individual identification. The categorical SPIM offers an alternative to using probability of identity criteria for classifying genotypes as unique, shifting the "shadow effect", where more than one individual in the population has the same genotype, from a source of bias to a source of uncertainty. We discuss the difficulties that real world data sets pose for latent identity SCR methods, most importantly, individual heterogeneity in detection function parameters, and argue that the addition of partial identity information reduces these concerns. We then discuss how the categorical SPIM can be applied to other wildlife sampling scenarios such as remote camera surveys, where natural or researcher-applied partial marks can be observed in photographs. Finally, we discuss how the categorical SPIM can be added to SMR, 2-flank SPIM, or other future latent identity.},

	abstract = {Decision-makers in wildlife policy require reliable population size estimates to justify interventions, to build acceptance and support in their decisions and, ultimately, to build trust in managing authorities. Traditional capture-recapture approaches present two main shortcomings, namely, the uncertainty in defining the effective sampling area, and the spatially-induced heterogeneity in encounter probabilities. These limitations are overcome using spatially explicit capture-recapture approaches (SCR). Using wolves as case study, and non-invasive DNA monitoring (faeces), we implemented a SCR with a Poisson observation model in a single survey to estimate wolf density and population size, and identify the locations of individual activity centres, in NW Iberia over 4,378 km2. During the breeding period, posterior mean wolf density was 2.55 wolves/100 km2 (95\%BCI = 1.87–3.51), and the posterior mean population size was 111.6 ± 18.8 wolves (95\%BCI = 81.8–153.6). From simulation studies, addressing different scenarios of non-independence and spatial aggregation of individuals, we only found a slight underestimation in population size estimates, supporting the reliability of SCR for social species. The strategy used here (DNA monitoring combined with SCR) may be a cost-effective way to generate reliable population estimates for large carnivores at regional scales, especially for endangered species or populations under game management.},

Bi-monthly FMD cycles started at middle age extended longevity, lowered visceral fat, reduced cancer incidence and skin lesions, rejuvenated the immune system, and retarded bone mineral density loss. In old mice, FMD cycles promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, lowered IGF-1 levels and PKA activity, elevated NeuroD1, and improved cognitive performance.

	abstract = {Bioacoustic methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. Sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of bioacoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals from bioacoustic arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. Therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of bioacoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. Models of attenuation in widespread use are based on Euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments. In some applications there are efforts to evaluate the detection range of sensors in response to local environmental characteristics at the sensor or at sentinel source locations with known environmental characteristics. However, attenuation is a function of the total environment between source and sensor, not just their locations. In this paper I develop a model of signal attenuation based on a non-Euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains resistance parameters that relate to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an array. Importantly, these parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ. In addition, drawing on analogy with classes of models known as spatial capture-recapture, I show that parameters of the non-Euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. Thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require localization of signals in heterogeneous environments.},

In this study, we develop a novel Bayesian SECR model that disentangles the process of animal movement through a detector from the process of recording data by a detector in the face of imperfect detection. We integrate this complexity into an advanced version of a recent SECR model involving partially identified individuals (Royle, 2015). We assess the performance of our model over a range of realistic simulation scenarios and demonstrate that estimates of population size N improve when we utilize the proposed model relative to the model that does not explicitly estimate trap detection probability (Royle, 2015). We confront and investigate the proposed model with a spatial capture-recapture data set from a camera trapping survey on tigers (Panthera tigris) in Nagarahole, southern India. Trap detection probability is estimated at 0.489 and therefore justifies the necessity to utilize our model in field situations. We discuss possible extensions, future work and relevance of our model to other statistical applications beyond ecology.},

Objective: Evaluation of tear production (Schirmer's tear test, STT) and measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) were performed in a population of captive wild ungulates in a Slovenian ZOO during routine annual health check. Animals studied: In total, 10 fallow deer (Dama dama), 25 mouflons (Ovis aries musimon), 20 alpine ibexes (Capra ibex), and three alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) were included in the study. Methods: Tear production was performed by Schirmer's tear test, IOP was measured with an applanation tonometer, and ophthalmological examination was conducted with slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Conjunctival swabs were taken and submitted for aerobic bacteriology and for detection of Chlamydia spp. and Mycoplasma spp. tested by PCR. Results: Average tear production (in mm/min) was 17.8 ± 3.16 for fallow deer, 17.9 ± 3.87 for mouflons, and 11.7 ± 3.87 for ibexes. Mean intraocular pressure (IOP, in mm Hg) was 14.1 ± 2.48 for fallow deer, 14.9 ± 2.20 for mouflons, and 13.1 ± 2.43 for ibexes. For chamois, average tear production and IOP were 14.5 ± 3.0 and 10.2 ± 2.5, respectively; this is the first record of STT I and IOP in chamois. Bacteriological swabs were positive for bacteria in 100\% of the fallow deer, 56\% of mouflons, 35\% of ibexes, and 100\% of chamois. Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Moraxella spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycoplasma spp. were not detected. Conclusion: The reported values were obtained in animals under manual restraint only to be applicative in similar conditions.},

	abstract = {This article introduces Rcapture, an R package for capture-recapture experiments. The data for analysis consists of the frequencies of the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three types of models. With a closed population model, the goal of the analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on the way in which the capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture features several models for these capture probabilities that lead to different estimators for N. In an open population model, immigration and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling; closed population models apply within primary periods and an open population model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates; their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack for open population models.},

	abstract = {* The challenges associated with monitoring low-density carnivores across large landscapes have limited the ability to implement and evaluate conservation and management strategies for such species. Non-invasive sampling techniques and advanced statistical approaches have alleviated some of these challenges and can even allow for spatially explicit estimates of density, one of the most valuable wildlife monitoring tools. * For some species, individual identification comes at no cost when unique attributes (e.g. pelage patterns) can be discerned with remote cameras, while other species require viable genetic material and expensive laboratory processing for individual assignment. Prohibitive costs may still force monitoring efforts to use species distribution or occupancy as a surrogate for density, which may not be appropriate under many conditions. * Here, we used a large-scale monitoring study of fisher Pekania pennanti to evaluate the effectiveness of occupancy as an approximation to density, particularly for informing harvest management decisions. We combined remote cameras with baited hair snares during 2013–2015 to sample across a 70 096-km2 region of western New York, USA. We fit occupancy and Royle–Nichols models to species detection–non-detection data collected by cameras, and spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models to individual encounter data obtained by genotyped hair samples. Variation in the state variables within 15-km2 grid cells was modelled as a function of landscape attributes known to influence fisher distribution. * We found a close relationship between grid cell estimates of fisher state variables from the models using detection–non-detection data and those from the SCR model, likely due to informative spatial covariates across a large landscape extent and a grid cell resolution that worked well with the movement ecology of the species. Fisher occupancy and density were both positively associated with the proportion of coniferous-mixed forest and negatively associated with road density. As a result, spatially explicit management recommendations for fisher were similar across models, though relative variation was dampened for the detection–non-detection data. * Synthesis and applications. Our work provides empirical evidence that models using detection–non-detection data can make similar inferences regarding relative spatial variation of the focal population to models using more expensive individual encounters when the selected spatial grain approximates or is marginally smaller than home range size. When occupancy alone is chosen as a cost-effective state variable for monitoring, simulation and sensitivity analyses should be used to understand how inferences from detection–non-detection data will be affected by aspects of study design and species ecology.},

	abstract = {© 2015 Fišer et al. Phenotypically similar species coexisting in extreme environments like sulfidic water are subject to two opposing eco-evolutionary processes: those favoring similarity of environment-specific traits, and those promoting differences of traits related to resource use. The former group of processes includes ecological filtering and convergent or parallel evolution, the latter competitive exclusion, character displacement and divergent evolution. We used a unique eco-evolutionary study system composed of two independent pairs of coexisting amphipod species (genus Niphargus) from the sulfidic caves Movile in Romania and Frasassi in Italy to study the relative contribution and interaction of both processes. We looked at the shape of the multifunctional ventral channel as a trait ostensibly related to oxygenation and sulfide detoxification, and at body size as a resource-related trait. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the sulfidic caves were colonized separately by ancestors of each species. Species within pairs were more dissimilar in their morphology than expected according to a null model based on regional species pool. This might indicate competitive interactions shaping the morphology of these amphipod species. Moreover, our results suggest that the shape of the ventral channel is not subject to long-term convergent selection or to the process of environmental filtering, and as such probably does not play a role in sulfide tolerance. Nevertheless, the ancestral conditions reconstructed using the comparative method tended to be more similar than null-model expectations. This shift in patterns may reflect a temporal hierarchy of eco-evolutionary processes, in which initial environmental filtering became later on superseded by character displacement or other competition-driven divergent evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Urban species encounter resources that are uncommon in nature, such as materials found in city waste. Many studies have shown that these can be harmful to wildlife. In Mexico City, house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests, which reduces the amount of ectoparasites, but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents. Yet, the reason for this behaviour is unknown. One possibility is that birds extract the cellulose fibres from discarded butts simply because they resemble feathers. Alternatively, disassembled cigarette butts may be brought to the nests because they repel ectoparasites. Here we tested the latter hypothesis by assessing whether house finches (C. mexicanus) increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a raise in ectoparasite load. When present, fibres from butts are concentrated in the nest lining. By taking it away, we simultaneously removed most of the butt material and collected the bulk of the tick population infesting each nest, as these parasites cluster in the lining. We removed the bedding of nests when chicks had recently hatched, and randomly assigned each nests to one of the following treatments: 1) addition of live ticks, 2) addition of dead ticks and 3) simulation of tick addition. Females in the live ticks’ treatment added more butt fibres to their nests than parents in control treatments. Additionally, the amount of butt fibres in the original lining also predicted the amount of fibres added after the manipulation. It seems that the tendency to bring to the nest cigarette butts is at least partially a response to current, and perhaps also past, parasite load. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Division of reproductive behaviour and alloparental care are key aspects of many animal societies. In cooperatively breeding species, variation in helping effort and unequal task participation are frequently observed. However, the extent to which the reproductive state of an individual affects the tasks performed during offspring care remains poorly understood. In the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola, approximately 40\% of females reproduce, and mothers show extended maternal care including eggsac tending, regurgitation feeding and matriphagy, in which they are consumed by the offspring. We asked whether and to what extent virgin females participate in extreme maternal care and whether they differ from reproducing females in foraging activity. We show that virgin females contributed to all aspects of extended brood care, including regurgitation feeding and matriphagy. This suggests a physiological adaptation in virgin females to cooperative breeding, since in the subsocial Stegodyphus lineatus only mated females provide extended maternal care. Although virgin females and mothers are behaviourally totipotent, we found evidence for task differentiation as virgins engaged less in brood care and more in prey attack than mothers. High relatedness among nestmates and low probability of future reproduction in virgin helpers suggest alignment of reproductive interests between mothers and allomothers. Therefore, extreme allomaternal care by virgin helpers can be considered an adaptation to cooperative breeding in social spiders.},

The uncertainty in population metrics due to data deficiencies, vague definitions of space and lack of standardized protocols is a major challenge for monitoring, managing and conserving amphibian and reptile populations globally. This is especially true for the slow-worm ( Anguis fragilis ), a cryptic and fossorial legless lizard; uncertainty about spatial variation in density has hindered conservation efforts (e.g. in translocation projects). Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) methods can be used to estimate density while simultaneously and explicitly accounting for space and individual movement. We use SCR to analyse mark–recapture data of the slow-worm that were collected using artificial cover objects (ACO). Detectability varied among ACO grids and through the season. Estimates of slow-worm density varied across ACO grids (13, 45 and 46 individuals ha−1, respectively). The estimated 95\% home range size of slow-worms was 0.38 ha. Our estimates provide valuable information about slow-worm spatial ecology that can be used to inform future conservation management.},

Thus, growing evidence revealing a gender bias against women-or favoring men-within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) settings is provocative and raises questions about the extent to which gender bias may contribute to women's underrepresentation within STEM fields. To the extent that research illustrating gender bias in STEM is viewed as convincing, the culture of science can begin to address the bias. However, are men and women equally receptive to this type of experimental evidence? This question was tested with three randomized, double-blind experiments-two involving samples from the general public (n = 205 and 303, respectively) and one involving a sample of university STEM and non-STEM faculty (n = 205). In all experiments, participants read an actual journal abstract reporting gender bias in a STEM context (or an altered abstract reporting no gender bias in experiment 3) and evaluated the overall quality of the research. Results across experiments showed that men evaluate the gender-bias research less favorably than women, and, of concern, this gender difference was especially prominent among STEM faculty (experiment 2). These results suggest a relative reluctance among men, especially faculty men within STEM, to accept evidence of gender biases in STEM. This finding is problematic because broadening the participation of underrepresented people in STEM, including women, necessarily requires a widespread willingness (particularly by those in the majority) to acknowledge that bias exists before transformation is possible.},

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

By taking into account the ancient DNA requirements, the duplex procedures that we developed are efficient not only on DNA extracted from bear faeces but also on ancient DNA extracted from a brown bear fossil 7,500 years old. Defined specifically for ursids, the procedure for faecal samples (co-amplification of ZFX/Y and SRY markers) appears more accurate than other published procedures, as it prevents cross-amplification of potential ingested prey and contamination (19 non-ursid species tested).

This has motivated a need to anticipate future patterns of range expansion.Weconducted a non-invasive, genetic, spatial capture-recapture (SCR) study to estimate black bear density and identify spatial patterns of population density that are potentially associated with range expansion.Wecollected hair samples in a 2,519-km2 study area in southern New York with barbed-wire hair snares and identified individuals and measured genetic diversity using 7 microsatellite loci and 1 sex-linked marker.Weestimated a mean density of black bears in the region of 13.7 bears/100km2, and detected a slight latitudinal gradient in density consistent with the documented range expansion. However, elevation and the amounts of forest, crop, and developed landcover types did not influence density, suggesting that bears are using a diversity of resources in this heterogeneous landscape outside their previously described distribution. These results provide the first robust baseline estimates for population density and distribution associated with different landcover types in the expanded bear range. Further, genetic diversity was comparable to that of non-expanding black bear populations in the eastern United States, and in combination with the latitudinal density gradient, suggest that the study area is not at the colonizing front of the range expansion. In addition, the diversity of landcover types used by bears in the study area implies a possible lack of constraints for further northern expansion of the black bear range. Our non-invasive, genetic, spatial capture- recapture approach has utility for studying populations of other species that may be expanding in range because SCR allows for the testing of explicit, spatial ecological hypotheses.},

We used kill interval (i.e. the number of days between consecutive ungulate kills) as a proxy of kill rate. Although brown bears can monopolize wolf kills, we found no support in either study system for the common assumption that they cause wolves to killmore often.On the contrary, our results showed the opposite effect. In Scan- dinavia,wolf packs sympatric with brownbears killed less often than allopatric packs during both spring (after bear den emergence) and summer. Similarly, the presence of bears atwolf-killed ungulateswas associated with wolves kill- ing less often during summer in Yellowstone. The consistency in results between the two systems suggests that brown bear presence actually reduces wolf kill rate.

Due to the fragmented quality of DNA derived from such samples, few methods span taxonomic groups beyond species.

PCR amplification of a 176 bp segment of the SRY gene indicates a male, whereas no amplification indicates a female. A 245 bp segment of the ZFX gene serves as a positive control. This method is internally consistent, and multiple trials confer confidence in results. It applies to at least three families (Canidae, Felidae, and Phocidae) in both carnivore suborders (Feliformia and Caniformia), rendering this protocol the first sex identification method with amplicon sizes appropriate for noninvasive samples suitable for multiple families within order Carnivora.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {The occurrence of Dermacentor reticulatus on the territory of Slovenia was not described before. By extensive 3.5 year sampling period, we obtained sufficient data allowing for the first time to clearly define the distribution rate and seasonal activity of adult D. reticulatus in this part of Europe, north-east Slovenia. A study was conducted from November 2003 to May 2007 to evaluate the comprehensive view of the annual seasonality of questing adult D. reticulatus. Ticks monitoring was conducted in three different localities/habitats: a) Muriša - wet meadows near oxbow lake of the river Mura; b) Murska šuma - swampy forest area between the confluence of the river Mura and Ledava, which is occasionally flooded; and c) Dolinski pašnik - meadows with old oak trees, forest edge and shrub communities. In total, 2511 ticks were collected by flagging. There were exclusively adults with female-biased sex ratio throughout the years in all sampling localities, namely for Muriša 59.5\% (1287 of 2164), Murska šuma 62.7\% (203 of 324) and Dolinski pašnik 60.8\% (14 of 23). Most of the ticks (89.2\%) were collected when the mean daily temperatures were ranging from 0 to 14.9ºC. The highest activity of D. reticulatus were noted in the spring, culminating in February-April/May, peaking in average in March and with considerably lower rate (3-8-times) in the second activity peak in autumn, culminating in the end of August/September-November. The greatest number of adults in autumn was collected in October or November. Dermacentor reticulatuswas not active during the summer months. The highest quantity of ticks was recorded in meadows near oxbow lake of the river Mura where was caught 6.6-times more ticks than in swampy forest area Murska šuma, which was occasionally flooded after huge rainfall and even 94-times more than in Dolinski pašnik. The confirmed occurrence of D. reticu- latus in north-eastern Slovenia provided evidence that this species has extended its range. Our findings point to an enlargement of Pannonian distribution area of the species. This study indicates that D. reticulatus can be ranked as a typical element of the fauna in north-eastern Slovenia.},

Harvest has the potential to cause three types of genetic change: alteration of population subdivision, loss of genetic variation, and selective genetic changes. To sustain the productivity of harvested populations, it is crucial to incorporate genetic considerations into management. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to disentangle genetic and environmental causes of phenotypic changes to develop management plans for individual species. We recommend recognizing that some genetic change due to harvest is inevitable. Management plans should be developed by applying basic genetic principles combined with molecular genetic monitoring to minimize harmful genetic change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The last few years, several algorithms and workflows have been developed to analyze forensic MPS data. However, none have yet been tailored to the needs of the forensic analyst who does not possess an extensive bioinformatics background. We developed our previously published forensic MPS data analysis framework MyFLq (My-Forensic-Loci-queries) into an open-source, user-friendly, web-based application. It can be installed as a standalone web application, or run directly from the Illumina BaseSpace environment. In the former, laboratories can keep their data on-site, while in the latter, data from forensic samples that are sequenced on an Illumina sequencer can be uploaded to Basespace during acquisition, and can subsequently be analyzed using the published MyFLq BaseSpace application. Additional features were implemented such as an interactive graphical report of the results, an interactive threshold selection bar, and an allele length-based analysis in addition to the sequenced-based analysis. Practical use of the application is demonstrated through the analysis of four 16-plex short tandem repeat (STR) samples, showing the complementarity between the sequence- and length-based analysis of the same MPS data.},

The recent advent of next-generation pyrosequencing has drastically accelerated microsatellite locus discovery by providing a greater amount of DNA sequencing reads at lower costs compared to other techniques. However, laboratory testing of PCR primers targeting potential microsatellite markers remains time consuming and costly. Here we show how to reduce this workload by screening microsatellite loci via bioinformatic analyses prior to primer design. Our method emphasizes the importance of sequence quality, and we avoid loci associated with repetitive elements by screening with repetitive sequence databases available for a growing number of taxa. Testing with the Yellowstripe Goatfish Mulloidichthys flavolineatus and the marine planktonic copepod Pleuromamma xiphias we show higher success rate of primers selected by our pipeline in comparison to previous in silico microsatellite detection methodologies. Following the same pipeline, we discover and select microsatellite loci in nine additional species including fishes, sea stars, copepods and octopuses.},

In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising {\textgreater}100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings.},

	abstract = {In Europe the most important hosts maintaining Ixodes ricinus tick populations are deer. Therefore, excluding deer by fencing or culling are potential tick management tools. Here we test the hypothesis that deer act as vehicles for moving ticks between two distinct habitats: forest and open heather moorland. We utilised an ideal "natural experiment" whereby forests were either fenced or unfenced to prevent or allow deer to move between habitats. We aimed to test the hypothesis that deer cause a net movement of ticks from high tick density areas, i.e. forests, to low tick density areas, i.e. open moorland. We recorded I. ricinus and host abundance in 10 unfenced and seven fenced forests and their respective surrounding heather moorland. We found that fenced forests had fewer deer and fewer I. ricinus nymphs than unfenced forests. However, we found no evidence that fencing forests reduced I. ricinus abundance on adjacent heather moorland. Thus there was insufficient evidence for our hypothesis that deer cause a net movement of ticks from forest onto adjacent moorland. However, we found that deer abundance generally correlates with I. ricinus abundance. We conclude that fencing can be used as a tool to reduce ticks and disease risk in forests, but that fencing forests is unlikely to reduce ticks or disease risk on adjacent moorland. Instead, reducing deer numbers could be a potential tool to reduce tick abundance with implications for disease mitigation. © 2010 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the importance of vertebrate species as tick hosts and as reservoir hosts in two endemic areas for Lyme borreliosis in Switzerland, we applied molecular methods for the analysis of bloodmeal source and Borrelia infection in questing Ixodes ricinus L. ticks. In total, 1,326 questing ticks were simultaneously analyzed for Borrelia and for blood meal remnants by using reverse line blot. An overall infection prevalence of 19.0\% was recorded for Borrelia sp., with similar rates in both sites. Using a newly developed method for the analysis of bloodmeal targeting the 12S rDNA mitochondrial gene, identification of host DNA from field-collected ticks was possible in 43.6\% of cases. Success of host identification at the genus and species level reached 72\%. In one site, host identification success reached its maximum in spring (93\% in May), decreasing in summer (20\% in July) and rising in autumn (73\% in October). In the other site, identification rate in ticks remained low from April to July and increased in autumn reaching 68\% in October and November. The most prevalent identified host DNA was artiodactyls in both sites. Red squirrel DNA was significantly more frequently detected in ticks collected in one site, whereas insectivore DNA was more frequent in ticks in the other site. DNA from more than one vertebrate host was detected in 19.5\% of nymphs and 18.9\% of adults. Host DNA was identified in 48.4\% of the Borrelia infected ticks. Although DNA from all Borrelia species was found in at least some ticks with DNA from mammals and some ticks with DNA from birds, our results confirm a general association of B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with rodents, and B. valaisiana and B. garinii with birds.},

The monthly variation in questing nymph density was negatively correlated with the saturation deficit; there was a strong decrease in tick numbers in late spring and summer as soon as the saturation deficit increased. A variation in tick density in relation to the saturation deficit was also observed between years; the tick density was high when the saturation deficit was low during spring and summer (1997) and was low when the saturation deficit was high (1998).

(Acari: Ixodidae), as well as microclimate features of the site of study, are described for a 9-year-long study (1994-2002) in north-central Spain. According to drag captures, larvae had a unimodal activity pattern, with a maximum observed around July-August, whereas nymphs displayed a bimodal pattern (May-June and August-September) with strong dominance of spring activity. An inversion of this pattern, with larger autumn peak, was observed in years with humid summers. Adults showed a small spring peak and a large autumn one. In the later years of the study, a small increase in the adult spring peak of activity was noticed, correlated with mild winters. Over the entire period of study, a clear increase in the total tick abundance was detected. Statistically significant differences between years were observed for some climate variables (saturation deficit, winter temperatures and number of days with temperatures above 6 degrees C), but a consistent and constant pattern of change was not observed in any climate variable. Temperature requirements for developing stages showed a sharp decrease in weeks 35-51 (eggs) and 38-50 (larvae and nymphs), a feature attributed to the presence of the morphogenetic diapause, beginning around September. Development rates obtained under quasi-natural conditions were almost twice those reported for other sites, suggesting an adaptation of this local, largely isolated I. ricinus population. According to drag captures and field-obtained development rates, interchange of nymphs between the two cohorts is common in this site, and seems to be influenced by the winter temperature and the date of larval engorgement.},

	abstract = {While the importance of random sequencing errors decreases at higher DNA or RNA sequencing depths, systematic sequencing errors (SSEs) dominate at high sequencing depths and can be difficult to distinguish from biological variants. These SSEs can cause base quality scores to underestimate the probability of error at certain genomic positions, resulting in false positive variant calls, particularly in mixtures such as samples with RNA editing, tumors, circulating tumor cells, bacteria, mitochondrial heteroplasmy, or pooled DNA. Most algorithms proposed for correction of SSEs require a data set used to calculate association of SSEs with various features in the reads and sequence context. This data set is typically either from a part of the data set being "recalibrated" (Genome Analysis ToolKit, or GATK) or from a separate data set with special characteristics (SysCall). Here, we combine the advantages of these approaches by adding synthetic RNA spike-in standards to human RNA, and use GATK to recalibrate base quality scores with reads mapped to the spike-in standards. Compared to conventional GATK recalibration that uses reads mapped to the genome, spike-ins improve the accuracy of Illumina base quality scores by a mean of 5 Phred-scaled quality score units, and by as much as 13 units at CpG sites. In addition, since the spike-in data used for recalibration are independent of the genome being sequenced, our method allows run-specific recalibration even for the many species without a comprehensive and accurate SNP database. We also use GATK with the spike-in standards to demonstrate that the Illumina RNA sequencing runs overestimate quality scores for AC, CC, GC, GG, and TC dinucleotides, while SOLiD has less dinucleotide SSEs but more SSEs for certain cycles. We conclude that using these DNA and RNA spike-in standards with GATK improves base quality score recalibration.},

Spike-in experiments have been successfully used for internal technology assessments by microarray manufacturers and for comparisons of competing data analysis approaches. The microarray literature is saturated with statistical assessments based on spike-in experiment data. Unfortunately, the statistical assessments vary widely and are applicable only in specific cases. This has introduced confusion into the debate over best practices with regards to which platform, protocols and data analysis tools are best. Furthermore, cross-platform comparisons have proven difficult because reported concentrations are not comparable. In this article, we introduce two new spike-in experiments, present a novel statistical solution that enables cross-platform comparisons, and propose a comprehensive procedure for assessments based on spike-in experiments. The ideas are implemented in a user friendly Bioconductor package: spkTools. We demonstrated the utility of our tools by presenting the first spike-in-based comparison of the three major platforms--Affymetrix, Agilent and Illumina.},

	abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makesedgeRthe leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important andDESeqmarginally outperforms the other tools.},

We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods.

HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method.

	abstract = {Estimating population size and resource selection functions (RSFs) are common approaches in applied ecology for addressing wildlife conservation and management objectives. Traditionally such approaches have been undertaken separately with different sources of data. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) provides a framework for jointly estimating density and multi-scale resource selection, and data integration techniques provide opportunities for improving inferences from SCR models. Here we illustrate an application of integrated SCR-RSF modeling to a population of American marten ( Martes americana ) in alpine forests of northern New England. Spatial encounter data from camera traps were combined with telemetry locations from radio-collared individuals to examine how density and space use varied with spatial environmental features. We compared multi-model inferences between the integrated SCR-RSF model with telemetry and a standard SCR model with no telemetry. The integrated SCR-RSF model supported more complex relationships with spatial variation in third-order resource selection (i.e., individual space use), including selection for areas with shorter distances to mixed coniferous forest and rugged terrain. Both models indicated increased second-order selection (i.e., density) for areas close to mixed coniferous forest, while the integrated SCR-RSF model had a lower effect size due to modulation from spatial variability in space use. Our application of the integrated SCR-RSF model illustrates the improved inferences from spatial encounter data that can be achieved from integrating auxiliary telemetry data. Integrated modeling allows ecologists to join empirical data to ecological theory using a robust quantitative framework to better address conservation and management objectives.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Studies of these relationships, however, often assume static environmental conditions, and rarely consider effects of competition with ecologically similar species. In many parts of their shared ranges, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and American black bears (U. americanus) have nearly complete dietary overlap and share similar life history traits. We therefore tested the hypothesis that density patterns of both bear species would reflect seasonal variation in available resources, with areas of higher primary productivity supporting higher densities of both species. We also hypothesized that interspecific competition would influence seasonal density patterns. Specifically, we predicted that grizzly bear density would be locally reduced due to the ability of black bears to more efficiently exploit patchy food resources such as seasonally abundant fruits. To test our hypotheses, we used detections of 309 grizzly and 597 black bears from two independent genetic sampling methods in spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models. Our results suggest grizzly bear density was lower in areas of high black bear density during spring and summer, although intraspecific densities were also important, particularly during the breeding season. Black bears had lower densities in areas of high grizzly bear density in spring; however, density of black bears in early and late summer was best explained by primary productivity. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that smaller-bodied, more abundant black bears may influence the density patterns of behaviorally-dominant grizzly bears through exploitative competition. We also suggest that seasonal variation in resource availability be considered in efforts to relate environmental conditions to animal density.},

	abstract = {Biologically generated turbulence has been proposed as an important contributor to nutrient transport and ocean mixing1–3. However, to produce non-negligible transport and mixing, such turbulence must produce eddies at scales comparable to the length scales of stratification in the ocean. It has previously been argued that biologically generated turbulence is limited to the scale of the individual animals involved
                4
              , which would make turbulence created by highly abundant centimetre-scale zooplankton such as krill irrelevant to ocean mixing. Their small size notwithstanding, zooplankton form dense aggregations tens of metres in vertical extent as they undergo diurnal vertical migration over hundreds of metres3,5,6. This behaviour potentially introduces additional length scales—such as the scale of the aggregation—that are of relevance to animal interactions with the surrounding water column. Here we show that the collective vertical migration of centimetre-scale swimmers—as represented by the brine shrimp Artemia salina—generates aggregation-scale eddies that mix a stable density stratification, resulting in an effective turbulent diffusivity up to three orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusivity of salt. These observed large-scale mixing eddies are the result of flow in the wakes of the individual organisms coalescing to form a large-scale downward jet during upward swimming, even in the presence of a strong density stratification relative to typical values observed in the ocean. The results illustrate the potential for marine zooplankton to considerably alter the physical and biogeochemical structure of the water column, with potentially widespread effects owing to their high abundance in climatically important regions of the ocean

When managing an economically valuable koala population, it shows that a decision based on α = 0.05 carries an expected cost over \$5 million greater than the optimal decision. For a species of such value, there is never any benefit in guarding against the spurious detection of declines and therefore management should proceed directly to recovery action. This result holds in most circumstances where the species’ value substantially exceeds its recovery costs. For species of lower economic value, we show that the conventional α-level of 0.05 rarely approximates the optimal decision-making threshold. This analysis supports calls for reversing the statistical ‘burden of proof’ in environmental decision-making when the cost of Type II errors is relatively high.},

Modelling the tick’s complex seasonal dynamics, upon which pathogen transmission potential depends, underpins the analysis of tick-borne disease risk and potential tick control. 2. We use laboratory- and field-derived empirical data to construct a population model for I. ricinus. The model is a substantially modified stage-classified Leslie matrix and includes functions for temperature-dependent development, density-dependent mortality and saturation deficit–meditated probability of questing. 3. The model was fitted to field data from three UK sites and successfully simulated seasonal patterns at a fourth site. After modification of a single parameter, the model also replicated divergent seasonal patterns in central Spain, but any biological factors underlying this geographical heterogeneity have not yet been identified. The model’s applicability to wide geographical areas is thus constrained, but in ways that highlight gaps in our knowledge of tick biology. 4. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model was generally robust, particularly to changes in density-independent mortality values, but was most sensitive to changes in parameters related to density-dependent mortality. 5. Synthesis and applications. Vector population models allow investigation into the effects of individual environmental factors on population dynamics in ways not easily possible by experimental manipulation of in situ populations.

The aim of this study was to determine the relative contribution of several abiotic and biotic factors potentially affecting questing activity and local abundance of I. ricinus in Italy, considering the scale at which these factors interact with the host-seeking ticks. Within EDEN, a large-scale EU collaborative project on eco-epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, we collected questing ticks for three consecutive years using a standard protocol at eleven sites in the Italian Alps and Apennines. A total of 25 447 I. ricinus were collected. All sites showed the same annual pattern of tick activity (bimodal for nymphs and unimodal for larvae and adults), although the abundance of nymphs was statistically different between sites and years. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model and a Linear Mixed Model fitted to data for nymphs, showed that while the principal variables affecting the local abundance of questing ticks were saturation deficit (an index combining temperature and relative humidity) and red deer density, the most important variable affecting questing nymph activity was saturation deficit. As for the timing of seasonal emergence, we confirmed that the threshold temperature at this latitude for larvae is 10°C (mean maximum) while that for nymphs is 8°C.},

However, conducting ecosystem assessments over representative spatial scales that are insensitive to local heterogeneity is challenging. We examine the link between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination and population density of an aquatic habitat specialist over a large spatial scale using non-invasive genetic spatial capture-recapture. Using American mink (Neovison vison), a predatory mammal and an indicator of aquatic ecosystems, we compared estimates of density in two major river systems, one with extremely high levels of PCB contamination (Hudson River), and a hydrologically independent river with lower PCB levels (Mohawk River). Our work supports the hypothesis that mink densities are substantially (1.64–1.67 times) lower in the contaminated river system. We demonstrate the value of coupling the indicator species concept with well-conceived and spatially representative monitoring protocols. PCBs have demonstrable detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, including mink, and these effects are likely to be profound and long-lasting, manifesting as population-level impacts. Through integrating non-invasive data collection, genetic analysis, and spatial capture-recapture methods, we present a monitoring framework for generating robust density estimates across large spatial scales.},

Yet, for species where individuals are indistinguishable, remote cameras’ ability to provide robust and precise density estimates has been limited without the use of invasive marking. 2.Using the American black bear as a model species, we evaluated methods for estimating wildlife densities using remote camera detections of unmarked individuals against estimates from spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models using individual detections. We also tested the effect of incorporating varying proportions of marked individuals on model accuracy and precision. 3.Spatial count (SC) models using unmarked individuals produced estimates of bear density within 0.6\% of those from SCR. We extended SC models to incorporate variation in density as a function of land use/land cover, and identified identical relationships between variation in bear densities and housing density as obtained using SCR. Incorporating individual detection data from simultaneous non-invasive genetic sampling lead to more precise, but biased estimates. 4.Synthesis and applications. Our results identify contexts in which camera count data can be used as an alternative to spatial capture-recapture (SCR) when individual identification is prohibitive. Spatial count models provided an accurate, but less precise replication of SCR density estimates and may provide consistent insights into spatial variation in density. Mixed samples of camera counts and auxiliary individual detections are likely to be of limited use, but fitting spatial count models to populations with partial visual markings could improve their precision.

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS—the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases—make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering—using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative—is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

	abstract = {Density estimation is integral to the effective conservation and management of wildlife. Camera traps in conjunction with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have been used to accurately and precisely estimate densities of “marked” wildlife populations comprising identifiable individuals. The emergence of spatial count (SC) models holds promise for cost-effective density estimation of “unmarked” wildlife populations when individuals are not identifiable. We evaluated model agreement, precision, and survey costs, between i) a fully marked approach using SCR models fit using non-invasive genetic data, and ii) an unmarked approach using SC models fit using camera trap data, for a recovering population of the mesocarnivore fisher (Pekania pennanti). The SCR density estimates ranged from 2.95 to 3.42 (2.18–5.19 95\% BCI) fishers 100 km−2. The SC density estimates were influenced by their priors, ranging from 0.95 (0.65–2.95 95\% BCI) fishers 100 km−2 for the uninformative model to 3.60 (2.01–7.55 95\% BCI) fishers 100 km−2 for the model informed by prior knowledge of a 16 km2 fisher home range. We caution against using strongly informative priors but instead recommend using a range of unweighted prior knowledge. Thin detection data was problematic for both SCR and SC models, potentially producing biased low estimates. The total cost of the genetic survey (\$47 610) was two-thirds of the camera trap survey (\$77 080), or comparable (\$75 746) if genetic sampling effort was increased to include sex and trap-behaviour covariates in SCR models. Density estimation of unmarked populations continues to be a series of trade-offs but as methods improve and integrate, so will our estimates.},

To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55\%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82\% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets.},

We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in {\textless}0.05\% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer.

This unusual extinction of large and slow-breeding animals provides some of the strongest support for a human contribution to their extinction and is consistent with various human hunting models, but it is difficult to explain by models relying solely on environmental change. It is an oversimplification, however, to say that a wave of hunting-induced extinctions swept continents immediately after first human contact. Results from recent studies suggest that humans precipitated extinction in many parts of the globe through combined direct (hunting) and perhaps indirect (competition, habitat alteration) impacts, but that the timing and geography of extinction might have been different and the worldwide magnitude less, had not climatic change coincided with human impacts in many places.},

Once part of a continuous, widespread population, panthers became isolated in south Florida more than a century ago. Numbers declined and the occurrence of genetic defects increased. Hoping to reverse the genetic damage, managers introduced eight female panthers from Texas into south Florida in the mid-1990s. This action was highly controversial and we explain the arguments for and against the intervention. We synthesized data systematically collected on the Florida panthers from before, during and after this management intervention. These data include information on movements, breeding, mortality, survivorship and range. There is no evidence that purebred Florida females produce fewer kittens at a later age or less often than do hybrid cats (i.e. those with a Texas ancestor). Hybrid kittens have about a three times higher chance of becoming adults as do purebred ones. Hybrid adult females survive better than purebred females; there is no obvious difference between the males. Males die younger than females, are more often killed by other males and are more likely to disperse longer distances into habitats that are dangerous to them. Hybrids are expanding the known range of habitats panthers occupy and use.},

Genetic Non-Invasive Sampling (gNIS) combined with Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture (SECR) modelling may provide a practical tool to obtain such estimates. Here, we evaluate for the first time the potential and limitations of this approach to estimate population densities for small mammals inhabiting patchily distributed habitats, focusing on the endemic Iberian Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae). Using 11 highly polymorphic microsatellites and two sex-linked introns, we compared population estimates in November/December 2011 based on live-trapping and gNIS and assessed the impact of distinct consensus criteria to differentiate unique genotypes. Live-trapping over 21 days captured 31 individuals, while gNIS over 5 days recorded 65–69 individuals. SECR models indicated that individual detectability was positively affected by live-trapping capture success on the previous occasion, while for gNIS, it was mainly affected by genotyping success rates and patch size. Live-trapping produced the lowest density estimates (mean ± SE) of 16.6 ± 3.2 individuals per hectare of suitable habitat (ind/ha). Estimates based on gNIS were higher and varied slightly between 25.2 ± 4.0 and 28.8 ± 4.5 ind/ha depending on assuming one or two genotyping errors, respectively, when differentiating individual genetic profiles. Results suggest that live-trapping underestimated the vole population, while the larger number of individuals detected through gNIS allowed better estimates with lower field effort. Overall, we suggest that gNIS combined with SECR models provides an effective tool to estimate small mammal population densities in fragmented habitats.},

	abstract = {MYC (also known as c-MYC) overexpression or hyperactivation is one of the most common drivers of human cancer. Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. MYC is a transcription factor, and many of its pro-tumorigenic functions have been attributed to its ability to regulate gene expression programs1,2,3. Notably, oncogenic MYC activation has also been shown to increase total RNA and protein production in many tissue and disease contexts4,5,6,7. While such increases in RNA and protein production may endow cancer cells with pro-tumour hallmarks, this increase in synthesis may also generate new or heightened burden on MYC-driven cancer cells to process these macromolecules properly8. Here we discover that the spliceosome is a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene in human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a component of the core spliceosome required for its assembly and catalytic activity. Core spliceosomal factors (such as SF3B1 and U2AF1) associated with BUD31 are also required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an increase in total precursor messenger RNA synthesis, suggesting an increased burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of many essential cell processes. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity and metastatic proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing, and that components of the spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.},

	abstract = {Over the past 75 years, a number of statisticians have advised that the data-analysis method known as null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) should be deprecated (Berkson, 1942; Halsey et al., 2015). The limitations of NHST have been extensively discussed, with an emerging consensus that current statistical practice in the biological sciences needs reform. However, there is less agreement on the specific nature of reform, with vigorous debate surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative (Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). An emerging view is that a more complete analytic technique would use statistical graphics to estimate effect sizes and their uncertainty (Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). As these estimation methods require only minimal statistical retraining, they have great potential to change the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking towards quantitative reasoning (Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016). The evolution of statistics has been inextricably linked to the development of improved quantitative displays that support complex visual reasoning (Tufte, 2001). We consider that the graphic we describe here as an estimation plot is the most intuitive way to display the complete statistical information about experimental data sets. However, a major obstacle to adopting estimation is accessibility to suitable software. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed free software that makes high-quality estimation plotting available to all. Here, we explain the rationale for estimation plots by contrasting them with conventional charts used to display NHST data, and describe how the use of these graphs affords five major analytical advantages.},

	abstract = {The aim of this guidance is to assess the accuracy and reliability of the methods for estimation of density (i.e. population size per area unit) and relative abundance (i.e. relative representation of a species in a particular ecosystem, a kind of proxy of the density) of wild boar and to provide indications for calculating reliable and accurate estimates of those parameters using comparable methods. For this purpose eighteen methods were reviewed and evaluated. Since counting wild boar on a large regional scale is unfeasible, estimations of density and abundance are reliable only at local scale in specific habitats. Three methods (camera trapping, drive counts, and distance sampling with thermography) were recommended to estimate wild boar density on a local scale, and guidelines for their implementation was provided. In particular camera trapping is a method that can be conducted everywhere, irrespective of the habitat specificities and at any time to generate comparable data. Wild boar demographic data obtained by different methods cannot directly be combined by simple equations but spatial models are needed to determine abundance and predicted densities that are reliable at larger scales. On a large spatial scale and to describe long-term trends, high quality hunting data statistics (collected on a fine spatial scale) have the highest availability and potential comparability potential across Europe, and these can be used in predictive spatial modelling of wild boar relative abundance and density. There is need for compiling and validating wild boar abundance data at different spatial scales: hunting bag data alone are not sufficient because a calibration with more accurate density estimation methods conducted at local scale is required. The latter are also required for evaluating predictive models for large areas and converting predicted relative abundances into densities.},

This study was done in a dense network of different types of habitats (total size of study area 16.26 ha) from open landscape to shrubland, the latter being a result of abandonment of traditional agricultural practices such as extensive mowing and grazing. Total population size was estimated to be approximately 1700 and 2700 for females and males, respectively. Median and maximum distances moved by males were 134 and 3493 m, and by females 138 and 3165 m, respectively. The average lifespan was ca. 7.1 and 7.5 days, with maximum recorded lifespans of 21 and 17 days for males and females, respectively. The greater capture probability recorded for males indicates their high activity, as they spend most of their time in ﬂight patrolling and searching for mates. A parabolic recruitment curve and protandry were also recorded. Both sexes are highly mobile. The spatial distribution of both sexes was roughly similar. The adult behaviour differed in different habitats, with more time spent feeding and resting when nectar plants were plentiful and more time spent ﬂying when they were rare. Although adults utilized nine nectar sources, only two were recorded in over 80\% of all the feeding occasions. In order to re-establish open grassland with some shrubland, traditional and mosaic management of the landscape should be revived at least to some extent.},

A signiﬁcantly higher percentage of VIE marks (80\%) than toe-clips (55\%) remained viable for the duration of the study. On average, toe-clips remained readable for 100 days, and VIE marks remained readable for 112 days. There were no signiﬁcant species differences in the length of time that either type of mark lasted. The hybrid VIE-C method represents an improvement over either method used alone, but the VIE mark will be more helpful in correctly reading and clarifying toe-clipping errors than will toe-clips be helpful in reading and clarifying VIE marks.},

Estimates of average species richness were lower from track tubes than from livetrapping. Regression models revealed that the track-tube index was at best a moderately good predictor of small mammal population estimates because both the form (linear versus curvilinear) and slope of the relationship varied between years. In addition, 95\% prediction intervals indicated low precision when predicting population estimates from new track-tube index observations. Track tubes required less time and expense than mark–recapture and eliminated handling of small mammals.

	abstract = {Ixodes ricinus is the most common tick species in Europe and vector of many diseases of humans. The risk of contracting such a disease is influenced by many factors, but one of the crucial points is questing activity of unfed ticks. In order to supplement the few literature data on patterns of diel activity of this tick species and to examine the correlations between data on diel activity of ticks and their small mammal hosts and some meteorological variables, a survey was performed. Diel activity of questing I. ricinus and small rodents was studied in a known natural tick-borne encephalitis virus focus over 7 months at one sampling day monthly. 1,063 I. ricinus ticks and 25 rodents were sampled. Air temperature and humidity data were also recorded in the 24 study plots at time of sampling. From April to October questing activity of nymphs increased in the 3-h-period after sunrise, comparing to activity of the 3 h before sunrise. Proportion of nymphs sampled 3 h after sunset compared to total sampled nymphs 3 h before and 3 h after sunset showed correlation to activity of rodents. In the period of April–July both nymphs and larvae showed stronger activity from sunrise to sunset, this turned to dominant nighttime activity in August–September, whereas activity changed to equal in day and night in October. Our results indicate that natural light and rodent population have positive effect on questing activity of I. ricinus.},

In the meadow, the mean larval and adult numbers varied significantly between 4 h time intervals with the peak activity from 2300 to 0300 h. In the forest, the tick numbers did not differ significantly between the time intervals. The association of the tick activity with certain meteorological variables was strongest in the meadow, where the mean numbers of all tick stages were negatively correlated with the temperature. The relative humidity was positively correlated only with the mean numbers of larvae. In contrast, the larval activity in the forest was positively and negatively correlated with the temperature and relative humidity, respectively, while the nymphal and adult activity showed no association with these climatic variables. The impact of the host activity on the tick diel activity is also discussed.},

Wherever possible supplementary data were obtained from opportunistic collections from cattle and other hosts.Analysis of over 1000 tick collections from cattle indicated that infestation rates of the most important species,Amblyomma variegatum andRhipicephalus appendiculatus vary in different ecological habitats: (i) In Western Province, infestations are much lower than elsewhere; (ii) in Central and Southern Provinces, moderate to high infestations occur; and (iii) in Eastern Province,R. appendiculatus numbers are generally low andA. variegatum numbers are moderate.These two species, however, have similar life cycles throughout their range with one generation per year. Larvae occur mainly from March to May, nymphae from May to September, and adults ofA. variegatum from October to December and ofR. appendiculatus from December to April.Boophilus decoloratus appears to have two to four generations per year but is uncommon during the rainy season. In some areas in central ZambiaRhipicephalus compositus adults are seasonally common in September–October whereasRhipicephalus evertsi is more or less ubiquitous. Low to moderate infestations ofHyalomma truncatum andHyalomma rufipes occur in most areas.At least 14 other less common or rare species ofRhipicephalus, Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis andIxodes were taken infrequently from cattle. These and other host-specific species were also collected from dogs, sheep, various wildlife hosts and the environment.Infestation rates, seasonality and host-relationship of tick species are discussed in relation to their ecology. Relevant biosystematic and disease relationships are reviewed briefly. The baseline data derived from this study are adequate for integrated analysis with those from other ecological and economic investigations to formulate tick control strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in north temperate regions worldwide, affecting an estimated 300,000 people annually in the United States alone. The incidence of LB is correlated with human exposure to its vector, the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). To date, attempts to model tick encounter risk based on environmental parameters have been equivocal. Previous studies have not considered (1) the differences between relative humidity (RH) in leaf litter and at weather stations, (2) the RH threshold that affects nymphal blacklegged tick survival, and (3) the time required below the threshold to induce mortality. We clarify the association between environmental moisture and tick survival by presenting a significant relationship between the total number of tick adverse moisture events (TAMEs - calculated as microclimatic periods below a RH threshold) and tick abundance each year.
Methods: We used a 14-year continuous statewide tick surveillance database and corresponding weather data from Rhode Island (RI), USA, to assess the effects of TAMEs on nymphal populations of I. scapularis. These TAMEs were defined as extended periods of time ({\textgreater}8 h below 82\% RH in leaf litter). We fit a sigmoid curve comparing weather station data to those collected by loggers placed in tick habitats to estimate RH experienced by nymphal ticks, and compiled the number of historical TAMEs during the 14-year record.
Results: The total number of TAMEs in June of each year was negatively related to total seasonal nymphal tick densities, suggesting that sub-threshold humidity episodes {\textgreater}8 h in duration naturally lowered nymphal blacklegged tick abundance. Furthermore, TAMEs were positively related to the ratio of tick abundance early in the season when compared to late season, suggesting that lower than average tick abundance for a given year resulted from tick mortality and not from other factors.
Conclusions: Our results clarify the mechanism by which environmental moisture affects blacklegged tick populations, and offers the possibility to more accurately predict tick abundance and human LB incidence. We describe a method to forecast LB risk in endemic regions and identify the predictive role of microclimatic moisture conditions on tick encounter risk.},

	abstract = {The worldwide decline of large carnivores is concerning, particularly given the important roles they play in shaping ecosystems and conserving biodiversity. Estimating the capacity of an ecosystem to support a large carnivore population is essential for establishing reasonable and quantifiable recovery goals, determining how population recovery may rely on connectivity, and determining the feasibility of investing limited public resources toward recovery. We present a case study that synthesized advances in habitat selection and spatially-explicit individual-based population modeling, while integrating habitat data, human activities, demographic parameters and complex life histories to estimate grizzly bear carrying capacity in the North Cascades Ecosystem in Washington. Because access management plays such a critical role in wildlife conservation, we also quantified road influence on carrying capacity. Carrying capacity estimatesranged from 83 to 402 female grizzly bears. As expected, larger home ranges resulted in smaller populations and roads decreased habitat effectiveness by over 30\%. Because carrying capacity was estimated with a static habitat map, the output is best interpreted as an index of habitat carrying capacity under current conditions. The mid-range scenario results of 139 females, or a total population of 278 bears, represented the most plausible scenario for this ecosystem. Grizzly bear distribution generally corresponded to areas with higher quality habitat and less road influence near the central region of the ecosystem. Our results reaffirm the North Cascades Ecosystem's capacity to support a robust grizzly bear population. Our approach, however, can assist managers anywhere ecosystem-specific information is limited. This approach may be useful to land and wildlife managers as they consider grizzly bear population recovery objectives and make important decisions relative to the conservation of wildlife populations worldwide.},

	abstract = {The Central Apennine brown bear population, that has been ascribed to the subspecies Ursus arctos marsicanus Altobello, 1921 and is endemic to Central Italy, actually survives as an isolated, small population potentially at high risk of extinction. The population of U. a. marsicanus is mostly located in Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park (Central Apennines). However, the Central Apennine peripheral distribution area of this subspecies is less known and it is presumed that bear presence occurs at lower density. The purpose of this study is to provide a new contribution to the knowledge of bear presence in this peripheral area, in order to enable its protection in the Central Apennines. The monitoring of bear presence was carried out in Sirente Velino Natural Regional Park and surrounding areas (600 km2) from January 2000 to December 2014. Monitoring was conducted by collecting data along opportunistic survey trails in areas where the presence of bears had been previously confirmed by direct observations. A total of 237 records of bear presence were collected during the study period. Distribution of historic bear data reported for the period 1900–1991 for the study area (n = 61) and present data are compared. Data show a continuous presence of bears in the study area during the last 15 years. The monitoring program has also provided evidence of the stable presence of wintering bears and a more or less continuous presence of breeding bears in the study area, although observations of females with cubs were not available every year. Results led us to speculate about a wider than previously expected stable presence of brown bears in the peripheral Apennine range. These peripheral areas of bear distribution, both inside and outside protected areas, are crucial for conservation and more effort must be made to estimate bear occurrence outside the core range.},

	abstract = {Of the 3 bear populations in Georgia, the population in the central portion of the state is the smallest, and is presumably geographically isolated from other Georgia populations. We used DNA capture-recapture hair-snare techniques to estimate density and derive abundance for the central Georgia black bear population. We analyzed 4 years of data (2012-2015) collected over 4, 8-week sampling periods, to determine bear density across a 1,126.97 km2 region. Using spatially explicit methods (SECR), we estimated female densities to be 0.194 bears/km2 in upland areas and 0.066 bears/km2 in bottomland areas. We found male densities to be 0.117 bears/km2 in upland areas and 0.040 bears/km2 in bottomland areas. We derived overall abundance of the bear population to be 428.20, 412.49, 439.84, and 458.23 bears for 2012-2015, respectively. The estimates of female detection probability from 2012-2015 were: 0.017 (SE=0.002), 0.018 (SE=0.002), 0.013 (SE=0.001), and 0.014 (SE=0.002). The estimates of male detection probability from 2012-2015 were: 0.012 (SE=0.00), 0.018 (SE=0.002), 0.013 (SE=0.001), and 0.014 (SE=0.001). We recommend continued population and harvest monitoring, with particular attention to female recruitment and mortality, as females drive reproductive rates and population numbers.},

	abstract = {Effective population size (Ne) is a key parameter for monitoring the genetic health of threatened populations because it reflects a population's evolutionary potential and risk of extinction due to genetic stochasticity. However, its application to wildlife monitoring has been limited because it is difficult to measure in natural populations. The isolated and well-studied population of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem provides a rare opportunity to examine the usefulness of different Ne estimators for monitoring. We genotyped 729 Yellowstone grizzly bears using 20 microsatellites and applied three single-sample estimators to examine contemporary trends in generation interval (GI), effective number of breeders (Nb) and Ne during 1982–2007. We also used multisample methods to estimate variance (NeV) and inbreeding Ne (NeI). Single-sample estimates revealed positive trajectories, with over a fourfold increase in Ne (≈100 to 450) and near doubling of the GI (≈8 to 14) from the 1980s to 2000s. NeV (240–319) and NeI (256) were comparable with the harmonic mean single-sample Ne (213) over the time period. Reanalysing historical data, we found NeV increased from ≈80 in the 1910s–1960s to ≈280 in the contemporary population. The estimated ratio of effective to total census size (Ne/Nc) was stable and high (0.42–0.66) compared to previous brown bear studies. These results support independent demographic evidence for Yellowstone grizzly bear population growth since the 1980s. They further demonstrate how genetic monitoring of Ne can complement demographic-based monitoring of Nc and vital rates, providing a valuable tool for wildlife managers.},

	abstract = {Capture-recapture studies are frequently used to monitor the status and trends of wildlife populations. Detection histories from individual animals are used to estimate probability of detection and abundance or density. The accuracy of abundance and density estimates depends on the ability to model factors affecting detection probability. Non-spatial capture-recapture models have recently evolved into spatial capture-recapture models that directly include the effect of distances between an animal’s home range centre and trap locations on detection probability. Most studies comparing non-spatial and spatial capture-recapture biases focussed on single year models and no studies have compared the accuracy of demographic parameter estimates from open population models. We applied open population non-spatial and spatial capture-recapture models to three years of grizzly bear DNA-based data from Banff National Park and simulated data sets. The two models produced similar estimates of grizzly bear apparent survival, per capita recruitment, and population growth rates but the spatial capture-recapture models had better fit. Simulations showed that spatial capture-recapture models produced more accurate parameter estimates with better credible interval coverage than non-spatial capture-recapture models. Non-spatial capture-recapture models produced negatively biased estimates of apparent survival and positively biased estimates of per capita recruitment. The spatial capture-recapture grizzly bear population growth rates and 95\% highest posterior density averaged across the three years were 0.925 (0.786–1.071) for females, 0.844 (0.703–0.975) for males, and 0.882 (0.779–0.981) for females and males combined. The non-spatial capture-recapture population growth rates were 0.894 (0.758–1.024) for females, 0.825 (0.700–0.948) for males, and 0.863 (0.771–0.957) for both sexes. The combination of low densities, low reproductive rates, and predominantly negative population growth rates suggest that Banff National Park’s population of grizzly bears requires continued conservation-oriented management actions.},

New approaches utilizing environmental DNA (eDNA) may provide supplementary, cost-effective tools for noninvasive genetic sampling. We tested whether eDNA from residual saliva on partially-consumed Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses might yield suitable DNA quality for noninvasive monitoring of brown bears (Ursus arctos). We compared the efficiency of monitoring brown bear populations using both fecal DNA and salivary eDNA collected from partially-consumed salmon carcasses in Southeast Alaska. We swabbed a range of tissue types from 156 partially-consumed salmon carcasses from a midseason run of lakeshore-spawning sockeye (O. nerka) and a late season run of stream-spawning chum (O. keta) salmon in 2014. We also swabbed a total of 272 scats from the same locations. Saliva swabs collected from the braincases of salmon had the best amplification rate, followed by swabs taken from individual bite holes. Saliva collected from salmon carcasses identified unique individuals more quickly and required much less labor to locate than scat samples. Salmon carcass swabbing is a promising method to aid in efficient and affordable monitoring of bear populations, and suggests that the swabbing of food remains or consumed baits from other animals may be an additional cost-effective and valuable tool in the study of the ecology and population biology of many elusive and/or wide-ranging species.},

	abstract = {Human development and climate change are two stressors that threaten numerous wildlife populations, and their combined effects are likely to be most pronounced along the human development-wildland interface where changes in both natural and anthropogenic conditions interact to affect wildlife. To better understand the compounding influence of these stressors, we investigated the effects of a climate-induced natural food shortage on the dynamics of a black bear population in the vicinity of Durango, Colorado. We integrated 4 years of DNA-based capture-mark-recapture data with GPS-based telemetry data to evaluate the combined effects of human development and the food shortage on the abundance, population growth rate, and spatial distribution of female black bears. We documented a 57\% decline in female bear abundance immediately following the natural food shortage coinciding with an increase in human-caused bear mortality (e.g., vehicle collisions, harvest and lethal removals) primarily in developed areas. We also detected a change in the spatial distribution of female bears with fewer bears occurring near human development in years immediately following the food shortage, likely as a consequence of high mortality near human infrastructure during the food shortage. Given expected future increases in human development and climate-induced food shortages, we expect that bear dynamics may be increasingly influenced by human-caused mortality, which will be difficult to detect with current management practices. To ensure long-term sustainability of bear populations, we recommend that wildlife agencies invest in monitoring programs that can accurately track bear populations, incorporate non-harvest human-caused mortality into management models, and work to reduce human-caused mortality, particularly in years with natural food shortages.},

	abstract = {Understanding what factors drive fluctuations in the abundance of endangered species is a difficult ecological problem but a major requirement to attain effective management and conservation success. The ecological traits of large mammals make this task even more complicated, calling for integrative approaches. We develop a framework combining individual-based modelling and statistical inference to assess alternative hypotheses on brown bear dynamics in the Cantabrian range (Iberian Peninsula). Models including the effect of environmental factors on mortality rates were able to reproduce three decades of variation in the number of females with cubs of the year (Fcoy), including the decline that put the population close to extinction in the mid-nineties, and the following increase in brown bear numbers. This external effect prevailed over density-dependent mechanisms (sexually selected infanticide and female reproductive suppression), with a major impact of climate driven changes in resource availability and a secondary role of changes in human pressure. Predicted changes in population structure revealed a nonlinear relationship between total abundance and the number of Fcoy, highlighting the risk of simple projections based on indirect abundance indices. This study demonstrates the advantages of integrative, mechanistic approaches and provides a widely applicable framework to improve our understanding of wildlife dynamics.},

We therefore genotyped 1622 common buzzard (Buteo buteo) chicks sampled over 12 consecutive years (2002–2013 inclusive) at 15 microsatellite loci. This data set allowed us to both compare single-sample with temporal approaches and explore temporal patterns in the effective number of parents that produced each cohort in relation to the observed population dynamics. We found reasonable consistency between linkage disequilibrium-based single-sample and temporal estimators, particularly during the latter half of the study, but no clear relationship between annual Ne estimates () and census sizes. We also documented a 14-fold increase in between 2008 and 2011, a period during which the census size doubled, probably reflecting a combination of higher adult survival and immigration from further afield. Our study thus reveals appreciable temporal heterogeneity in the effective population size of a natural vertebrate population, confirms the need for long-term studies and cautions against drawing conclusions from a single sample.},

	abstract = {The use of DNA data is ubiquitous across animal sciences. DNA may be obtained from an organism for a myriad of reasons including identification and distinction between cryptic species, sex identification, comparisons of different morphocryptic genotypes or assessments of relatedness between organisms prior to a behavioural study. DNA should be obtained while minimizing the impact on the fitness, behaviour or welfare of the subject being tested, as this can bias experimental results and cause long-lasting effects on wild animals. Furthermore, minimizing impact on experimental animals is a key Refinement principle within the "3Rs" framework which aims to ensure that animal welfare during experimentation is optimised. The term 'non-invasive DNA sampling' has been defined to indicate collection methods that do not require capture or cause disturbance to the animal, including any effects on the behaviour or fitness. In practice this is not always the case, as the term 'non-invasive' is commonly used in the literature to describe studies where animals are restrained or subjected to aversive procedures. We reviewed the non-invasive DNA sampling literature for the past six years (346 papers published in 2013-2018) and uncovered the existence of a significant gap between the current use of this terminology (i.e. 'non-invasive DNA sampling') and its original definition. We show that 58\% of the reviewed papers did not comply with the original definition. We discuss the main experimental and ethical issues surrounding the potential confusion or misuse of the phrase 'non-invasive DNA sampling' in the current literature and provide potential solutions. In addition, we introduce the terms 'non-disruptive' and 'minimally disruptive' DNA sampling, to indicate methods that eliminate or minimise impacts not on the physical integrity/structure of the animal, but on its behaviour, fitness and welfare, which in the literature reviewed corresponds to the situation for which an accurate term is clearly missing. Furthermore, we outline when these methods are appropriate to use.},

	abstract = {Abundance and density estimates are central to the field of ecology and are an important component of wildlife management. While many methods exist to estimate abundance from individually identifiable animals, it is much more difficult to estimate abundance of unmarked animals. One step toward noninvasive abundance estimation is the use of passive detectors such as remote cameras or acoustic recording devices. However, existing methods for estimating abundance from cameras for unmarked animals are limited by variable detection probability and have not taken full advantage of the information in camera trapping rate. We developed a time to event (TTE) model to estimate abundance from trapping rate. This estimate requires independent estimates of animal movement, so we collapsed the sampling occasions to create a space to event (STE) model that is not sensitive to movement rate. We further simplified the STE model into an instantaneous sampling (IS) estimator that applies fixed-area counts to cameras. The STE and IS models utilize time-lapse photographs to eliminate the variability in detection probability that comes with motion-sensor photographs. We evaluated the three methods with simulations and performed a case study to estimate elk (Cervus canadensis) abundance from remote camera trap data in Idaho. Simulations demonstrated that the TTE model is sensitive to movement rate, but the STE and IS methods are unbiased regardless of movement. In our case study, elk abundance estimates were comparable to those from a recent aerial survey in the area, demonstrating that these new methods allow biologists to estimate abundance from unmarked populations without tracking individuals over time.},

	abstract = {Cancer driver genes, i.e., oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are involved in the acquisition of important functions in tumors, providing a selective growth advantage, allowing uncontrolled proliferation and avoiding apoptosis. It is therefore important to identify these driver genes, both for the fundamental understanding of cancer and to help finding new therapeutic targets. Although the most frequently mutated driver genes have been identified, it is believed that many more remain to be discovered, particularly for driver genes specific to some cancer types. In this paper we propose a new computational method called LOTUS to predict new driver genes. LOTUS is a machine-learning based approach which allows to integrate various types of data in a versatile manner, including informations about gene mutations and protein-protein interactions. In addition, LOTUS can predict cancer driver genes in a pan-cancer setting as well as for specific cancer types, using a multitask learning strategy to share information across cancer types. We empirically show that LOTUS outperforms three other state-of-the-art driver gene prediction methods, both in terms of intrinsic consistency and prediction accuracy, and provide predictions of new cancer genes across many cancer types.},

	abstract = {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome, and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g. from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

	abstract = {Human persecution and habitat loss have endangered large carnivore populations worldwide, but some are recovering, exacerbating old conflicts. Carnivores can injure and kill people; the most dramatic form of wildlife-human conflict. In Scandinavia, the brown bear (Ursus arctos) population increased from {\textasciitilde}500 bears in 1977 to {\textasciitilde}3300 in 2008, with an increase in injuries, fatalities, and public fear of bear attacks. We reviewed media coverage and interviewed victims to explore how bear population trends, hunter education, and other factors may have influenced the number of injuries and fatalities in Scandinavia from 1977 to 2016. We found 42 incidents with 42 injuries and 2 fatalities; 42 were adult men, one was an adult woman conducting forestry work, and one was a boy skiing off-piste. Thirty-three adult men were hunting bears, moose, or small game, often with a hunting dog, and 26 had shot at the bear at 8±11 m before injury. Eleven nonhunters were conducting forestry work, inspecting a hunting area, picking berries, tending livestock, hiking, harassing a denned bear, and one person was killed outside his house at night. Eight of the 11 incidents of nonhunters involved female bears with cubs; three of these family groups were in dens and two were on carcasses. The annual number of hunters injured/killed was mostly influenced by the increase in the bear population size. The pattern was similar regarding injuries/fatalities to other outdoor users, but the relation with the bear population size was weaker than for hunters, and the null model was equally supported. Bear physiology at denning may make encounters with bears more risky in the fall, when bears show prehibernation behavior. Awareness and education efforts, especially among hunters, seem important to ensure human safety. Recreationists and forestry workers should avoid dense vegetation or make noise to warn bears of their presence.},

	abstract = {Genetic data can provide a powerful tool for those interested in the ecology and management of wildlife, especially when it is combined with behavioral, demographic, or spatial information. Although the full potential of genetic approaches to the study of wildlife populations has yet to be realized, the application of genetic analyses is becoming increasingly feasible and cost-effective. This is due primarily to recent advances in the number and types of genetic markers available, the development of sophisticated data analysis methods, and increased automation of laboratory instrumentation. These technological advances have broadened the list of questions that can be answered with genetic data, allowing inference at multiple levels of resolution (inter-individual to inter-specific) and temporal and spatial scales. Genetic data can be used to assess mating systems, hybridization, gene flow, effective population size, and population viability. Genetic data can also be used to define management units; identify individuals, sex, and species; and to provide insights into demographic patterns associated with the reduction and expansion of populations. All of these factors are either related to a species' ecology or provide important information for management and conservation. We describe some applications of genetic data, discuss processes affecting genetic variation within and among populations, and provide an overview of genetic terminology and how genetic variation is measured. As genetic methods become progressively more accessible and adaptable to an ever-widening array of questions, it is expected that they will play an increasingly important role in the ecology and management of wildlife.},

	abstract = {Because of its biological characteristics, its important place in the minds of humans, and the considerable international interest for its conservation, management of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Europe is challenging. The Brown Bear Management Plan for Croatia (BMPC) was approved in 2004 and addressed interests such as ecology, aesthetics, and economics, as well as concern for the safety of people and property. It attempts to ensure conditions for the long-term survival of the brown bear, a species listed as endangered by some international regulations but as a game species (subject to regulated hunting) in others, including Croatia. Careful evaluation of actions affecting population size represents the most critical part of this plan. Those actions should sustain long-term viability of the bear population while maintaining densities at a level that minimize human–bear conflict. To achieve this goal, a series of actions and measures have to be regulated that are related to (1) bear habitat, (2) human activities in the habitat (e.g., highway construction, feeding of bears by humans), (3) prevention of problematic bear occurrences, and (4) the scientific monitoring of population changes. Although the plan's development and implementation is the responsibility of bear management experts, various interests groups were considered. In large carnivore management, and especially in bear management, there are no final and universal solutions. Changes in the number of bears, areas of their presence, or behavior require new decisions. This plan offers guidelines for the decision-making process, and, because it includes a revision process, can be adapted to address new circumstances that arise. Citizens interested in conservation, not only in Croatia but also in neighboring countries, expect Croatia to work toward maintaining the long-term existence of as many bears as possible in appropriate habitats, with as few negative effects as possible. This plan is an important step in fulfilling those expectations.},

	abstract = {One difficulty in the conservation of endangered wildlife is the lack of reliable information on its status. This lack of knowledge can often be attributed to financial and logistic constraints as well as the lack of trained personnel to collect data. We test a simple method to study bears in the southern Balkans by inspecting power poles, which are used by bears for marking and rubbing purposes. We created a network of barbed-wire fitted poles for the collection of hair samples, evenly distributed throughout six study areas. During 87 sampling sessions in the main study area, we collected 191 samples and identified six microsatellite loci that were variable enough for individual bear identification. The most and best-quality hair samples were collected during the mating period, and DNA was most successfully extracted from samples remaining {\textless}4 weeks in the field. In the six study areas, we identified 47 bears. An advantage of using power poles for hair sampling is their availability and accessibility; no bait is required, and the network can be easily set up. A drawback may be an unequal capture probability of sex and age classes of bears. Despite this limitation, using power poles proved to be a simple and cheap method for the noninvasive genetic study of bears that did not require any prior knowledge on habitat use and activity patterns. The method is suitable for large-scale surveys to estimate distribution and relative densities of bears and could also be applied for studying other species.},

The lack of information concerning the bear population in the Republic of Macedonia and bear acceptance by local people inspired us to explore local knowledge and perceptions concerning bears that could be relevant for their conservation. Accordingly, we adopted a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews to determine how the specific behaviour and ecology of bears can influence, through interactions, local peoples' knowledge and perceptions. Our results show that due to numerous interactions, the informants' knowledge appeared to be detailed and consistent, both internally and with existing scientific literature about bears. Bear specific behaviour allows them to be located, individualised and thus appropriated by villagers, and also to be identified as an alter-ego. For the villagers, the occasional harmfulness of a bear is not the result of a general characteristic of bears in general, but of some individual bear's behaviour. Finally, bears enjoy a relatively good image as long as local people can react against individuals that cause damage. However, direct or indirect poaching of bears is still a main concern for the Macedonian brown bear's conservation.},

Attitude studies repeated in time that can demonstrate such change are rare. Our study surveyed Croatian rural inhabitants in 2002 and in 2008 and analyzed their responses to detect a change in attitudes toward brown bears (Ursus arctos) over time. Important developments occurring in Croatia at the time of our research included a more centralized and more clearly defined bear management strategy, and an increase in the bear population. We constructed models to explain respondent’s value orientations, their level of perceived threat and their acceptance capacity for bears. Findings show that while value orientations and the overall level of perceived threat did not change over time, bear acceptance capacity was reduced. This suggests that the increase in the bear population and perhaps the more centralized bear management reduced respondents’ willingness to accept a larger bear population. We conclude that continuous public involvement in bear management is essential in order to maintain a feeling of control over the bear among the local population. Furthermore we argue that hunting is an important form of public involvement in the region, serving to reinforce existence and bequest values of the bear and increase its public acceptance.},

Since no empirical or deductive evidence was presented to show how established methods of selective reanalysis can fail to detect errors, I conclude that this proposal would dramatically increase costs without improving data quality. While the optimal number of markers will vary between study populations, I present 1 example in which identical results would have been achieved with 3 markers or with the 15 suggested by McKelvey and Schwartz (2004).},

This requires alternative statistical approaches to those used in traditional mark–recapture studies.

	abstract = {Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) is becoming a popular tool for population estimation. However, multiple NGS studies have demonstrated that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping errors can bias demographic estimates. These errors can be detected by comprehensive data filters such as the multiple-tubes approach, but this approach is expensive and time consuming as it requires three to eight PCR replicates per locus. Thus, researchers have attempted to correct PCR errors in NGS datasets using non-comprehensive error checking methods, but these approaches have not been evaluated for reliability. We simulated NGS studies with and without PCR error and ‘filtered’ datasets using non-comprehensive approaches derived from published studies and calculated mark–recapture estimates using CAPTURE. In the absence of data-filtering, simulated error resulted in serious inflations in CAPTURE estimates; some estimates exceeded N by200\%. When data filters were used, CAPTURE estimate reliability varied with per-locus error (Eμ). At Eμ=0.01, CAPTURE estimates from filtered data displayed {\textless}5\% deviance from error-free estimates. When Eμ was 0.05 or 0.09, some CAPTURE estimates from filtered data displayed biases in excess of 10\%. Biases were positive at high sampling intensities; negative biases were observed at low sampling intensities. We caution researchers against using non-comprehensive data filters in NGS studies, unless they can achieve baseline per-locus error rates below 0.05 and, ideally, near 0.01. However, we suggest that data filters can be combined with careful technique and thoughtful NGS study design to yield accurate demographic information.},

Statistical methods that estimate the probability of sampling identical genotypes using theoretical equations generally assume random associations between alleles within and among loci. These calculations are probably inaccurate for many animal and plant populations due to population substructure. We evaluated the accuracy of a probability of identity (P(ID)) estimation by comparing the observed and expected P(ID), using large nuclear DNA microsatellite data sets from three endangered species: the grey wolf (Canis lupus), the brown bear (Ursus arctos), and the Australian northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorinyus krefftii). The theoretical estimates of P(ID) were consistently lower than the observed P(ID), and can differ by as much as three orders of magnitude. To help researchers and managers avoid potential problems associated with this bias, we introduce an equation for P(ID) between sibs. This equation provides an estimator that can be used as a conservative upper bound for the probability of observing identical multilocus genotypes between two individuals sampled from a population. We suggest computing the actual observed P(ID) when possible and give general guidelines for the number of codominant and dominant marker loci required to achieve a reasonably low P(ID) (e.g. 0.01–0.0001).},

countries manage the brown bear at the national level, although several ministries are often involved. All European countries with bears within their
national borders (except Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Yugoslav Federation) have signed the Bern Convention; almost half have prepared, or are
preparing, a management plan for brown bears. In addition, most countries engage in monitoring, research, information dissemination, and conservation
activities. In areas where bear range includes human settlements, damage to livestock, orchards, and beehives occurs but, in most countries,
stakeholders are compensated for damage, either by the state, regional government, or hunter clubs. In 1995-96 about 1.15 million US\$ was paid to
compensate such damage throughout Europe.},

	abstract = {In this study we tested a newly-developed instrument (an automatized DNA extractor MAxWell16-Promega), in order to test if DNA isolation can be performed more efficiently on feacal samples collected from three different species: bears, wolfs and capercaillies. We also evaluate a simple method for samples preservation in the field, which include the preservation of faeces in vials filled with ethanol (90\%). This method we have used is fast and simple. The time spent for isolating DNA from each batch of 16 samples is approximately 38 min, no further processes needed. The extracted DNA can be used immediately in the downstream analyses. No further wash of the samples, or other purification method is needed. The DNA should not be diluted for the amplification step, likewise the PCR product is not recommended to be diluted for the fragment analysis step.},

	abstract = {New technologies have enabled the investigation of biology and human health at an unprecedented scale and in multiple dimensions. These dimensions include myriad properties describing genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, phenotype, and lifestyle. No single data type, however, can capture the complexity of all the factors relevant to understanding a phenomenon such as a disease. Integrative methods that combine data from multiple technologies have thus emerged as critical statistical and computational approaches. The key challenge in developing such approaches is the identiﬁcation of effective models to provide a comprehensive and relevant systems view. An ideal method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying important features and predicting outcomes, by harnessing heterogeneous data across several dimensions of biological variation. In this Review, we describe the principles of data integration and discuss current methods and available implementations. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine. Finally, we discuss current challenges in biomedical integrative methods and our perspective on the future development of the ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Recently, the geographical origins of Ashkenazic Jews (AJs) and their native language Yiddish were investigated by applying the Geographic Population Structure (GPS) to a cohort of exclusively Yiddish-speaking and multilingual AJs. GPS localized most AJs along major ancient trade routes in northeastern Turkey adjacent to primeval villages with names that resemble the word “Ashkenaz.” These findings were compatible with the hypothesis of an Irano-Turko-Slavic origin for AJs and a Slavic origin for Yiddish and at odds with the Rhineland hypothesis advocating a Levantine origin for AJs and German origins for Yiddish. We discuss how these findings advance three ongoing debates concerning 1) the historical meaning of the term “Ashkenaz;” 2) the genetic structure of Ashkenazic Jews and their geographical origins as inferred from multiple studies employing both modern and ancient DNA and an original ancient DNA analysis; and 3) the development of Yiddish. Due to the rising popularity of geo-localization tools to address questions of origin we briefly discuss the advantages and limitations of popular tools with focus on the GPS approach. Our results reinforce the non-Levantine origins of AJs.},

	abstract = {Large herbivores respond to fluctuations in predation and hunting risk. The temporal scale of risk heterogeneity affects behavioral responses and determines the usefulness of metrics to quantify them. We present a conceptual framework to link anti-predator responses to risk fluctuations and appropriate metrics, based on temporal scale. We applied this framework to investigate movement responses of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to hunting risk, measured using movement rate and home range size. Because movements are also affected by reproductive phases, we considered potential effects of the rut in parallel to hunting risk. We compared movements of male and female roe deer in a protected site versus 2 hunted sites during and outside the hunting season and rut. We detected differences in movement rates in response to different hunting management practices. We did not detect effects for hunting regimes or between sexes during the rut when using home range size as the response variable. During the hunting season, movement rates were lower in the hunted sites than in the protected site, irrespective of sex. We did not observe differences in movement rates among sites outside of the hunting season. Males had higher movement rates than females during the rut in only 1 site. Our findings supported the hypothesis that roe deer decrease movements when exposed to high hunting risk. The effect of the rut on movements was negligible except for 1 study site. We suggest that movement rate is a more useful metric than home range size for assessing movement responses to hunting. © 2018 The Wildlife Society},

	abstract = {The common wall lizard has been widely introduced across Europe and overseas. We investigated the origin of putatively introduced Podarcis muralis populations from two southern Europe localities: (i) Ljubljana (Slovenia), where uncommon phenotypes were observed near the railway tracks and (ii) the port of Vigo (Spain), where the species was recently found 150 km far from its previously known range. We compared cytochrome-b mtDNA sequences of lizards from these populations with published sequences across the native range. Our results support the allochthonous status and multiple, long-distance origins in both populations. In Ljubljana, results support two different origins, Serbia and Italy. In Vigo, at least two separate origins are inferred, from western and eastern France. Such results conﬁrm that human-mediated transport is promoting biological invasion and lineage admixture in this species. Solid knowledge of the origin and invasion pathways, as well as population monitoring, is crucial for management strategies to be successful.},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for the detection and quantitative analysis of messenger RNA molecules in a biological sample and is useful for studying cellular responses. RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology—the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.},

Recently developed approaches based on remotely collected data and capture-recapture models, though representing a valid alternative to more traditional methods, have found little application to species with limited morphological variation. We implemented a camera trap capture-recapture study to survey wolf packs in a 560-km2 area of Central Italy. Individual recognition of focal animals (alpha) in the packs was possible by relying on morphological and behavioural traits and was validated by non-invasive genotyping and inter-observer agreement tests. Two types (Bayesian and likelihood-based) of spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) models were fitted on wolf pack capture histories, thus obtaining an estimation of pack density in the area.},
